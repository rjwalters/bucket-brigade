description: Vision-model critic for the report skill. Renders the report to PDF and per-page PNGs, then uses a vision-language model to score rendered-only defects (figure legibility, wide-table overflow, page-break artifacts, palette adherence) that markdown-side review and audit critics cannot see.

# report-vision — Vision-language-model critic

**Role**: rendered-artifact critic.
**Reads**: latest `<project>/<thread>.{N}/report.md` (renders to `report.pdf` + per-page PNGs on demand).
**Writes**: `<project>/<thread>.{N}.vision/` with `_review.json` (canonical schema, `kind=vision`), `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`, and per-page PNGs in `pages/`.

This critic exists because the report skill's markdown-source critics never *look at* the rendered deliverable. `report-review` scores the prose and structure; `report-audit` walks the citation chain. Neither sees what the recipient sees: a wide specification table that overflows the right margin and silently drops a column, a figure that is illegible at the recipient's printed page scale, a section heading orphaned at the bottom of a page with its body on the next, or a chart whose colors ignore the report palette. Dimension 7 (Format / presentation quality) in `rubric.md` is exactly this concern — but the source-side reviewer can only guess at it from the markdown. This critic answers it from pixels.

The report PDF is paginated prose, not 16:9 slides, so the failure modes differ from `deck-vision`: instead of vertical-overflow-per-slide and mathtext-on-charts, the load-bearing defects are **table overflow** (the most common and most damaging — a wide spec table clipped at the page edge loses data the recipient never knows was there), **page-break artifacts** (orphaned headings, widow lines, a figure split across a page boundary), **figure legibility** at print scale, and **palette adherence** for embedded charts.

## Owned vision dimensions (four, scored /5 each, /20 total)

This critic owns a separate **report vision rubric subset** alongside the report's main 8-dimension /40 rubric (`rubric.md`). The vision dims appear in the aggregated scorecard via the existing mean-of-non-null aggregator (`anvil/lib/critics.py::aggregate`); no schema or aggregation changes are required.

The rubric is composed from the framework `VisionDimension` / `VisionRubric` primitives in `anvil/lib/vision.py` — it does NOT use `default_vision_rubric()` (those six dims are deck-shaped: slide overflow, mathtext, slide density). The report rubric is built inline:

```python
from anvil.lib.vision import VisionDimension, VisionRubric

REPORT_VISION_DIMENSIONS = (
    VisionDimension(
        name="figure_legibility",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Embedded figures and chart labels are readable at the "
            "recipient's page scale (letter/A4 print). 5 = every axis "
            "label, legend, and annotation is legible; 0 = key figures "
            "unreadable without zooming the PDF."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="table_overflow",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Wide specification tables fit within the page text block. "
            "5 = all columns and cell contents fully visible; 0 = a table "
            "is clipped at the right margin and load-bearing columns or "
            "values are silently dropped."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="layout_artifacts",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Page-break and flow quality: no orphaned headings (a heading "
            "alone at the bottom of a page), no widow lines, no figure or "
            "table split across a page boundary, consistent headers/"
            "footers. 5 = clean pagination throughout; 0 = pervasive "
            "break artifacts that fragment the reading flow."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="palette_adherence",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Embedded charts match the report's palette (the report "
            "`assets/style.css` theme colors, not default matplotlib). "
            "5 = consistent palette across all charts; 0 = default "
            "matplotlib colors clash with the report theme."
        ),
    ),
)

REPORT_VISION_RUBRIC = VisionRubric(
    dimensions=REPORT_VISION_DIMENSIONS,
    rubric_id="anvil-report-vision-v1",
)
```

| Dim | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| rv1 | `figure_legibility` | Chart axis labels, legends, annotations too small to read at print scale. The report equivalent of `deck-vision`'s `axis_legibility` + `label_cropping`. |
| rv2 | `table_overflow` | Wide spec tables clipped at the right margin — the report's signature defect. A column or cell value disappears past the text block edge. Source-side critics cannot see this because the markdown table is well-formed; the overflow is a render-time layout event. |
| rv3 | `layout_artifacts` | Orphaned headings, widow lines, figures/tables split across page boundaries, inconsistent running headers/footers. Paginated-document failure modes that have no slide analogue. |
| rv4 | `palette_adherence` | Embedded charts that ignore the report theme palette (default matplotlib colors instead of the `style.css` theme). |

The four report vision dims are scored 0–5 each. The vision critic puts `null` on the report's 8 main-rubric dimensions (it does not own them); other critics (`report-review`, `report-audit`) put `null` on rv1–rv4. The aggregator merges the scorecards cleanly per the existing rules.

## Critical flags (two shipped types)

This critic reuses the two framework critical-flag types (no new flag types — the framework taxonomy in `anvil/lib/vision.py` is authoritative):

- **`rendered_overflow_unrecoverable`** (`CRITICAL_FLAG_RENDERED_OVERFLOW_UNRECOVERABLE`) — content cut off in a way that loses load-bearing information. For reports this is most often a **wide table clipped at the right margin** that drops a column the recipient needs (a tolerance, a part number, a measured value), or a figure split across a page boundary that loses an axis. Raised when the VLM identifies a specific named entity or value lost in the clipped region.
- **`mathtext_artifact_breaks_meaning`** (`CRITICAL_FLAG_MATHTEXT_ARTIFACT_BREAKS_MEANING`) — a `$X` rendered as italic math where the dollar sign carries semantic weight, or LaTeX/mathtext source rendered literally in a way that destroys a number's meaning. Reports carry financial figures and engineering quantities; the same artifact that bites decks bites reports.

Both flag types short-circuit the aggregated verdict to `BLOCK`. Other vision findings surface as `Finding` items with severity `major` / `minor` / `nit`.

## Inputs

- **Project + thread path** (positional argument): `<project>/<thread>`.
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<project>/<thread>.{N}/report.md`.
- **Rendered PDF**: `<project>/<thread>.{N}/report.pdf` — produced by `report-figures` or by this critic on demand via `anvil.lib.render.render_pandoc_to_pdf` (with the report's `assets/pandoc-defaults.yaml`).
- **Per-page PNGs**: produced by `anvil.lib.render.render_pdf_to_pngs` from the PDF.
- **VLM**: Anthropic SDK by default; consumers without an API key inject a callback per `anvil/lib/vision.py`.

## Outputs

```
<project>/<thread>.{N}.vision/
  pages/
    page-1.png, page-2.png, ...    Per-page PNGs at 150 DPI (configurable; bump to 200+ for fine table-overflow inspection)
  _review.json                     Canonical schema, kind=vision, rendered_artifact=report.pdf
  _meta.json                       { critic, role, started, finished, model, scorecard_kind }
  _progress.json                   { version, thread, project, phases.vision.{state,started,completed} }
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the vision sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The three top-level files (`_review.json`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.vision.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.vision/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.vision.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob. The `pages/` subdirectory is staged inside the staging dir but is NOT validated by the required-files manifest (per `staged_sidecar`'s flat-manifest contract).

## Procedure

1. **Discover state** + **resume check** (per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md`). Find the highest `N` with `<project>/<thread>.{N}/report.md`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<project_root>)` where `<project_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.vision.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed VLM session (issue #350). If `<thread>.{N}.vision/` exists (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete), exit early (idempotent).
2. **Open the staged sidecar** for the vision dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<project>/<thread>.{N}.vision, required_files=["_review.json", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write below MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.vision.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.vision/` path. On clean context exit, the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name (issue #350). Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "thread": "<thread>",
     "project": "<project-slug>",
     "for_version": <N>,
     "phases": { "vision": { "state": "in_progress", "started": "<ISO>" } }
   }
   ```
   and **`_meta.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "critic": "vision",
     "role": "report-vision.md",
     "started": "<ISO>",
     "finished": null,
     "model": "claude-opus-4-7-20251022",
     "schema_version": 1,
     "scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"
   }
   ```
   See `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` and `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` for the canonical shapes.

3. **Ensure `report.pdf` exists**:
   - If `<project>/<thread>.{N}/report.pdf` exists and is newer than `report.md`, use it.
   - Otherwise, call `anvil.lib.render.render_pandoc_to_pdf(report_md, out_pdf, defaults=<assets/pandoc-defaults.yaml>)`. (In practice `report-figures` has usually already produced `report.pdf`; this critic re-renders only if it is missing or stale.)

4. **Render per-page PNGs**:
   - Call `anvil.lib.render.render_pdf_to_pngs(pdf, out_dir=<project>/<thread>.{N}.vision/pages/, dpi=150)`.
   - Returns a sorted list of PNG paths (`page-1.png`, `page-2.png`, ...).

5. **Run the vision critic** with the report-specific rubric:
   ```python
   from anvil.lib.vision import VisionCritic, VisionDimension, VisionRubric

   rubric = VisionRubric(
       dimensions=REPORT_VISION_DIMENSIONS,   # the four dims above
       rubric_id="anvil-report-vision-v1",
   )
   critic = VisionCritic(critic_id="report-vision")
   review = critic.critique(
       images=page_pngs,
       rubric=rubric,
       version_dir="<project>/<thread>.<N>",
       rendered_artifact="report.pdf",
       context="This is an {N}-page customer-facing technical report.",
   )
   ```
   Consumers without an Anthropic API key (CI, offline development) construct the critic with a `callback=` instead.

6. **Write `_review.json`**:
   - The `critique` call already validated the `Review` against the canonical schema.
   - Serialize with `review.model_dump_json(indent=2)` to `<project>/<thread>.{N}.vision/_review.json`.

7. **Update `_progress.json`** and `_meta.json` inside the staging dir to `state: done` / `finished: <ISO>`. The `_progress.json` write MUST be the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires it to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies every name in the required-files manifest exists in the staging dir, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.vision.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.vision/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.

8. **Report**: one-line status, e.g. `Vision critic on acme-q2/findings.2 → acme-q2/findings.2.vision/ (vision total 14/20; 3 findings; 1 critical flag: rendered_overflow_unrecoverable)`.

## Idempotence and resumability

- Standard: completed = no-op; crashed = re-runnable after deleting partial output.
- **Stale render**: if `<thread>.{N}/report.pdf` is older than `<thread>.{N}/report.md` (report source updated since render), re-render and re-evaluate. The PDF is the source of truth for this critic.
- **Stale PNGs**: if PNGs in `pages/` are older than the PDF, re-render.

## Renderer dependencies

- **pandoc**: `brew install pandoc` (macOS) / `apt-get install pandoc` (Debian). The `anvil.lib.render.render_pandoc_to_pdf` helper assumes `pandoc` is on PATH. (A PDF engine — e.g. a LaTeX install or `wkhtmltopdf` — is required for pandoc to emit PDF; this matches the report skill's existing render dependency.)
- **pdftoppm** (poppler): `brew install poppler` (macOS) / `apt-get install poppler-utils` (Debian). The `anvil.lib.render` helper falls back to `pdf2image` if installed.

## VLM dependencies

- **Anthropic SDK** (default path): `pip install anthropic`. The default model is `claude-opus-4-7-20251022`; pass a different `model=` to override.
- **No SDK required** (callback path): consumers without an API key inject a `callback=` per `anvil/lib/vision.py`. This is the path the report-vision unit tests use.

## Aggregation behavior

This critic's `_review.json` is discovered by `anvil.lib.critics.discover_critics` exactly like the `report-review` and `report-audit` siblings. The aggregator merges its scorecard into the composite verdict per the existing rules:

- The vision dims (rv1–rv4) appear in the aggregated scorecard alongside the report's 8 main-rubric dims.
- Per-dim `critical=True` ORs across critics; non-empty `critical_flags` forces `Verdict.BLOCK`.
- The `report-revise` command (with no code changes) consumes the vision findings via the same discover-glob → aggregate pattern. See `report-revise.md`'s D7 note for the figure-source-fix guidance.

See `anvil/lib/README.md` § "Rendered-artifact review (`kind: vision`)" for the worked example.

## Relationship to `report-review` and `report-audit`

The report skill runs `.review/` and `.audit/` as parallel siblings by default. `.vision/` is an additional optional sibling in the same "N parallel critics, one reviser" sense:

- `report-review` owns the eight prose/structure dimensions from `rubric.md` (it can fill dim 7 from the markdown, but only as a guess about layout).
- `report-audit` owns the citation chain and factual correctness.
- `report-vision` owns rv1–rv4 — the rendered-only layout defects that neither source-side critic can observe.

A report can reach `AUDITED` without a vision pass, but a report delivered to a recipient without a vision pass has not been validated against rendered-only defects (a clipped table, an illegible figure). For customer-facing material the recommendation is to run `report-vision` before `report-promote`; the reviser surfaces a missing vision pass as a gap in `changelog.md`.

## Notes for the report-vision agent

- **Always evaluate the rendered PNGs, not the markdown source.** A well-formed markdown table can still overflow the page text block after pandoc lays it out. The whole point of this critic is that the layout is invisible in markdown.
- **Table overflow is the signature report defect.** A wide specification table clipped at the right margin silently drops a column the recipient never knows existed. This is the report's most damaging rendered defect — treat a clipped load-bearing column as a `rendered_overflow_unrecoverable` critical flag, not a minor finding.
- **Vision findings often require fixing `exhibits/src/*` or the table source, not `report.md` prose.** A finding flagging palette mismatch on a chart is a chart-script fix; a finding flagging axis-label legibility is a DPI/figsize fix; a finding flagging table overflow may require restructuring the table (fewer columns, landscape orientation, or splitting it) rather than editing prose. The `report-revise` command surfaces this guidance to the reviser explicitly (see its D7 note).
- **Critical flags are sparingly used.** The two shipped types catch information loss (a clipped table that drops a value) and semantic loss (mathtext that drops a `$`). Other defects surface as findings, not flags.
- **Be specific.** A finding that says "the spec table on page 4 is clipped after the 'Tolerance' column" is actionable; "the report has table issues" is not. Cite the page in the `evidence_span` as `report.pdf:page=<N>`.

**Scorecard kind declaration**: This critic's `_meta.json` SHOULD include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md`. The canonical payload is `_review.json` per #26 (the prose siblings are not produced — the vision critic ships `_review.json` directly).
