  "story": "Low extinguish efficiency (κ=0.3) means diminishing returns from multiple workers at the same fire, while lower rewards (A=50) reduce the value of saving houses. Moderate work cost (c=0.6) punishes inefficient clustering. The challenge is coordinating to avoid overcrowding while still addressing fires.",
