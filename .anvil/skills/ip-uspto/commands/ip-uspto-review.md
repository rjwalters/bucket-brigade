name: ip-uspto-review
description: General reviewer critic for the ip-uspto skill. Owns rubric dimensions 6 (specification completeness), 7 (drawing-text correspondence), and 8 (formal compliance). Scores against the 9-dimension /45 rubric (≥39 advance threshold). Writes a sibling .review/ directory with the uniform critic output schema.

# ip-uspto-review — General reviewer

**Role**: general reviewer critic.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/` (all of `spec.tex`, `claims.tex`, `abstract.txt`, `drawings/`).
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.review/` with `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`.

The reviewer sibling directory is **read-only once written**. Revisions consume it; they never modify it.

## Rubric dimensions owned

Per `rubric.md` ownership map:

| # | Dimension | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | Specification completeness | 5 |
| 7 | Drawing-text correspondence | 5 |
| 8 | Formal compliance (37 CFR 1.71–1.84) | 5 |

The reviewer MAY also contribute scores to dimensions it does not primarily own (e.g., it may notice a §112(b) antecedent-basis issue and score Dimension 3 — but the s112 critic is the primary owner). When the reviewer contributes a non-owned score, that score participates in the mean aggregation alongside the primary critic's score.

For dimensions 1–5 (claim breadth, §112, §101, novelty) and dimension 9 (claim-spec correspondence, jointly owned by `s112` + `claims`), the reviewer leaves the score as `null` unless it has a specific observation.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex`.
- **Rubric**: `anvil/skills/ip-uspto/rubric.md`.
- **Optional consumer override**: `.anvil/skills/ip-uspto/rubric.overrides.md` (additional critical-flag examples; never reduces the base rubric).
- **Optional `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` flag** (issue #368): when set, the reviewer re-routes its staged_sidecar output from `<thread>.{N}.review/` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>/`, re-targets the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/` (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/`) since the current version's legacy review IS the prior review for a rescore pass, and stamps `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` + `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"` (overwriting any placeholder `rescore_state: "scheduled"` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply`). When the flag is unset, behavior is byte-identical to the default review path. See step 3 for the full re-routing contract.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.review/
  _summary.md       Critic tag, critical flag, top-level rubric block, per-dimension scorecard (owns 6, 7, 8), top revision priorities
  findings.md       Itemized findings (severity, location, rationale, suggested fix)
                    + "Rubric version transition" subsection (conditional, when prior rubric differs)
  _meta.json        { critic, role, started, finished, model, schema_version, scorecard_kind: "machine-summary",
                      rubric_id, rubric_total, advance_threshold }
  _progress.json    Phase state for the reviewer
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the review sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The four files (`_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.review.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed reviewer session (issue #350). If `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete), exit early (idempotent).
2. **Resume check**: per the staged-sidecar shape introduced in issue #350, a partial review left behind by a mid-cycle interrupt manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` directory; the step 1 sweep has already removed it. Backwards-compat: if a legacy pre-#350 `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists WITHOUT `_summary.md`, delete the dir and re-review.
3. **Open the staged sidecar** for the review dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.review, required_files=["_summary.md", "findings.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write below MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` path. On clean context exit, the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name (issue #350). Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json` for the review dir. Also initialize `_meta.json` with `scorecard_kind: "machine-summary"`, `rubric_id: "anvil-ip-uspto-v2"`, `rubric_total: 45`, and `advance_threshold: 39` (see `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` §"The discriminator" — the three rubric-stamping fields are required for new reviews per issue #346 and are **independent of `scorecard_kind`** per the snippet's discriminator contract; `"anvil-ip-uspto-v2"` is the ip-uspto skill's current /45 rubric identifier per `anvil/skills/ip-uspto/rubric.md` line 3). The rubric-stamping fields let downstream consumers compare scores apples-to-apples across the `/40 → /45` migration without re-reading the skill's current `rubric.md`. Also load the **prior review sibling** at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json` when present and cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or `None` when the prior sibling is absent — first iteration — or lacks the field — legacy pre-#346 review). The cached `prior_rubric_id` feeds the `_summary.md.rubric` block at step 9 + the `findings.md` rubric-transition subsection (step 10b) when the prior rubric differs from the current `"anvil-ip-uspto-v2"`.

   **When `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` is set** (issue #368) — the rebackport reviewer-hook contract:
   - **Re-derive `final_dir`** from `<thread>.{N}.review` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>`. The staging directory derived by `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staging_path_for(final_dir)` correspondingly becomes `.<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>.tmp/` — no separate code path is needed; the same `staged_sidecar(final_dir=...)` call works with the rescore sidecar path. The `scorecard_kind: "machine-summary"` discriminator is preserved verbatim (ip-uspto is the only skill in the suite emitting machine-summary — that discriminator is independent of the rescore-mode re-routing).
   - **Re-target the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/_meta.json`** (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json`). Under rescore mode, the legacy review at `<thread>.{N}.review/` IS the prior review — the rescore is re-scoring the SAME version's body against an updated rubric, not advancing to a new version. Cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or fall back to `--legacy-rubric` from the rebackport tool when the legacy review lacks the field — pre-#346).
   - **Stamp `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` and `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"`** in addition to the standard rubric-stamping fields. The placeholder `_meta.json` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply` carries `rescore_state: "scheduled"`; this reviewer overwrites it with `"completed"` once the full review (_summary.md / findings.md) has landed inside the staging dir. The `rescore_source: "anvil:rubric-rebackport"` field from the placeholder is preserved (or added if absent). The `/45` rubric total + ≥39 advance threshold are preserved verbatim in the stamped fields.
   - **All other behavior is unchanged** — same per-dimension scoring (dims 6, 7, 8 owned; others left `null`), same findings emission, same `_summary.md.rubric` block (now carrying the legacy review's rubric as `prior_rubric_id`). The legacy `<thread>.{N}.review/` dir is NEVER mutated — the rescore is a side-car write only.
   - **When `--rescore-mode` is unset**, the steps above DO NOT fire and the review path is byte-identical to the default behavior documented in the rest of this step.
4. **Read inputs**: load all of `<thread>.{N}/` and `rubric.md` + any consumer override.
   - **Consult `_outline.json`** as the structural ground truth for coherence checks. The outline records the section render plan (ids, order, `claim_tree`, per-feature `subsections`, figure list, `drawn_from` pointers from claims into the detailed description). Use it to:
     - confirm every claim in `claim_tree` traces to a detailed-description subsection via `drawn_from`;
     - confirm the abstract's coverage aligns with the `summary` section's `key_points`;
     - confirm the figures enumerated in `brief-description-of-drawings.figures` correspond to entries in `drawings/drawing-descriptions.md`.
   - The reviewer is NOT required to score `_outline.json` itself or enforce its presence — the drafter and reviser own that contract. The outline is a *reading aid* for coherence checks; light-touch adoption only at this stage.
5. **Evaluate Dimension 6 — Specification completeness** (score 0–5):
   - Are FIELD, BACKGROUND, SUMMARY, BRIEF DESCRIPTION, DETAILED DESCRIPTION present and proportionate?
   - Does the detailed description cover every inventive feature claimed in CLAIMS?
   - Are embodiments, alternatives, and ranges present where the brief specified them?
   - Score per the calibration guide in `rubric.md`.
   - Justification: cite specific spec section(s).
6. **Evaluate Dimension 7 — Drawing-text correspondence** (score 0–5):
   - For each reference numeral in `spec.tex`, does it appear in at least one drawing (or drawing stub description)?
   - For each reference numeral in drawings, does it appear in `spec.tex`?
   - Does `BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS` list every figure in `drawings/`?
   - Are figure captions consistent between brief description and the drawing files themselves?
   - In v0, drawings are typically stubs; the check is against `drawing-descriptions.md` entries until figures are rendered.
   - Score per calibration.
7. **Evaluate Dimension 8 — Formal compliance** (score 0–5):
   - This dimension partially overlaps with `ip-uspto-pre-flight`. Pre-flight catches the deterministic violations; the reviewer adds judgment on:
     - Section heading prose quality (not just presence).
     - Paragraph-level structure within `DETAILED DESCRIPTION` (well-organized? logical flow?).
     - Claim drafting conventions (preamble style, transitional phrase: `comprising`/`consisting of`/`consisting essentially of`).
   - Note: if pre-flight has been run on this version (look for `<thread>.{N}.preflight/_summary.md`), incorporate its findings into the rationale rather than re-running deterministic checks.
   - Score per calibration.
8. **Identify reviewer-level critical flags** (rare): the reviewer may set a critical flag for issues like:
   - Specification is so disorganized that examination would be impossible.
   - Drawings contradict the spec in a way that introduces indefiniteness.
   - The application as drafted does not appear to describe the invention claimed in the brief (severe spec-claim mismatch).

   **Append `score_history` row with `rubric_id` (issue #346)**: the orchestrator (the command that drives review→revise iterations) appends one row to `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.metadata.score_history` per finished review iteration. Per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Convergence fields → score_history", the canonical row shape is `{iteration, total, threshold, rubric_id}` — for the ip-uspto skill at /45, that's `{iteration: <N>, total: <computed-total>, threshold: 39, rubric_id: "anvil-ip-uspto-v2"}`. A thread that spans the `/40 → /45` migration records different `rubric_id` values across its rows; readers tolerate rows missing `rubric_id` per the backwards-compat contract (treat as `"unknown/legacy"`).
9. **Write `_summary.md`** in the rubric's specified format with a top-level `rubric` block (issue #346) sibling to the per-dimension scorecard. Per-dimension scorecard has all 9 rows but only 6, 7, 8 carry scores from this critic (others are `null` with justification `n/a — see <other critic>`). The `rubric` block carries the rubric the reviewer scored against so a downstream consumer aggregating across versions does not need to walk back to `anvil/skills/ip-uspto/rubric.md` (which may have changed between v3 and v5 of a long thread that spanned the `/40 → /45` migration). Shape:

   ```markdown
   # Review summary

   ```json
   {
     "critic": "review",
     "for_version": <N>,
     "rubric": {
       "id": "anvil-ip-uspto-v2",
       "total": 45,
       "advance_threshold": 39,
       "dimensions": 9,
       "prior_rubric_id": "anvil-ip-uspto-v1"
     },
     "dimensions": { /* 9-dim partial scorecard per rubric.md; this critic scores 6, 7, 8 */ },
     "critical_flag": false
   }
   ```
   ```

   The `rubric` block fields:
   - `id` (`str`): the rubric identifier — `"anvil-ip-uspto-v2"` for the current /45 rubric. Mirrors `_meta.json.rubric_id`.
   - `total` (`int`): the rubric's declared `total` — `45` (preserves flat-weight design: 9 dims × 5 each).
   - `advance_threshold` (`int`): the rubric's declared advance threshold — `39`.
   - `dimensions` (`int`): the count of weighted dimensions — `9`.
   - `prior_rubric_id` (`str | null`, conditional): present when the prior review sibling at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` exists. Value is the prior `_meta.json.rubric_id` when present, or `null` when the prior sibling lacks the field (legacy pre-#346 review). **Omitted entirely** on the first iteration.
   - `prior_rubric_inferred` (`str`, conditional): present when `prior_rubric_id == null` AND a prior review sibling exists. Value is `"/40-legacy"` to signal "this thread's prior iteration was scored against the pre-#346 /40 rubric (whatever the skill shipped at the time)".

   The block is **observational only** — it does NOT affect verdict, critical flags, or `advance`.
10. **Write `findings.md`** with itemized findings (severity, location, rationale, suggested fix). Findings group by dimension.
10b. **Emit rubric-version-transition subsection in `findings.md` when the prior rubric differs (issue #346)**: when the cached `prior_rubric_id` from step 3 is non-`None` AND differs from the current `"anvil-ip-uspto-v2"`, OR when `prior_rubric_id == None` AND a prior review sibling exists (legacy pre-#346 review), append a `## Rubric version transition` subsection to `findings.md` sibling to the existing dim-grouped findings. Three shapes:

   When the prior rubric is a different stamped id:
   ```
   ## Rubric version transition

   This iteration was scored against `anvil-ip-uspto-v2` (/45, ≥39); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` was scored against `anvil-ip-uspto-v1` (/40, ≥35). The score delta `<prior_total>/40 → <current_total>/45` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/45` against the `≥39/45` threshold.
   ```

   When the prior rubric is legacy (no `rubric_id` stamped):
   ```
   ## Rubric version transition

   This iteration was scored against `anvil-ip-uspto-v2` (/45, ≥39); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` predates per-review rubric version stamping (issue #346) and was scored against `/40-legacy` — the rubric this skill shipped before the `/40 → /45` migration (likely `anvil-ip-uspto-v1`, /40, ≥35). The score delta `<prior_total>/40-legacy → <current_total>/45` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/45` against the `≥39/45` threshold.
   ```

   When the prior rubric matches the current rubric (the steady-state case — no transition surfaced):
   ```
   (subsection omitted entirely)
   ```

   The subsection is **observational** — it does NOT affect the verdict, the critical-flag list, or the `advance` decision. Backwards-compat: a legacy review sibling produced before this contract shipped does NOT need to be re-emitted.
11. **Write `_meta.json`** (finalize from the step 3 init by setting `finished`) and finalize `_progress.json` to `done` inside the staging dir. The `_progress.json` write MUST be the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires it to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies every name in the required-files manifest exists in the staging dir, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.review/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.
12. **Report**: print the path and a one-line status (e.g., `Reviewed acme-widget.2 → acme-widget.2.review/ (D6=4, D7=3, D8=5; no critical flag)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

- Completed review is never re-run.
- Crashed review is re-runnable after deleting partial output.
- Validation is by file existence (does `_summary.md` exist and parse?), not solely by flag.

## Notes for the reviewer agent

- **Specification completeness ≠ length.** A 60-page spec that fails to describe an inventive feature scores worse than a 20-page spec that covers everything.
- **Drawing correspondence is mechanical but high-leverage.** Orphan reference numerals on either side are the single most common issue in first drafts. Be thorough.
- **Defer to pre-flight on the mechanical Dim 8 stuff.** Read its findings (if present) and incorporate by reference, then add judgment on the things pre-flight can't measure (prose quality, claim-drafting voice).
- **Be terse in findings.** The reviser is reading every critic's findings. Long-form justification belongs in `_summary.md` per-score rationale; findings should be short and actionable.

## `_progress.json` snippet (review sibling)

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "thread": "<slug>",
  "for_version": <N>,
  "phases": {
    "review": { "state": "done", "started": "<ISO>", "completed": "<ISO>" }
  }
}
```


## Scorecard kind

This critic emits the `machine-summary` scorecard kind per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md`. The `_meta.json` MUST include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` so the `ip-uspto-revise` aggregator can correctly discriminate this sibling from any `human-verdict` siblings (e.g., consumer-added narrative critics).

## `_meta.json` snippet (review sibling)

```json
{
  "critic": "review",
  "role": "ip-uspto-review.md",
  "started":  "<ISO>",
  "finished": "<ISO>",
  "model": "<model-id>",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "scorecard_kind": "machine-summary",
  "rubric_id": "anvil-ip-uspto-v2",
  "rubric_total": 45,
  "advance_threshold": 39
}
```

The three `rubric_*` / `advance_threshold` fields are required for new reviews (post-issue #346) and absent-tolerated for legacy reviews. They are **independent of `scorecard_kind`** per the snippet's discriminator contract — both `human-verdict` and `machine-summary` critics carry the rubric stamping. They let downstream consumers compare scores apples-to-apples across rubric migrations without re-reading the skill's current `rubric.md`.
