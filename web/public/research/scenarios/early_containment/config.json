  "story": "Fires start aggressively with high spread rate (β=0.35) and many initial fires (30%), but moderate extinguish efficiency (κ=0.6) means coordinated early action can contain them. Delaying response leads to cascading failures across the town.",

    "How quickly must agents respond to prevent chain reactions?",
    "Is early coordination more valuable than distributed coverage?",
