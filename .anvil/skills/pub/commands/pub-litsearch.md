# pub-litsearch — Literature-search critic

**Role**: literature-search critic (sibling, read-only).
**Reads**: `<thread>/BRIEF.md`, `<thread>/refs/` (any author-supplied source material), `<thread>/refs.bib` (if present). For a re-run after a reviewer flags missing prior work: also the latest `<thread>.{N}/main.tex` and any `<thread>.{N}.review/comments.md` entries tagged as related-work concerns.
**Writes**: `<thread>.0.litsearch/` (initial, pre-draft) or `<thread>.{N}.litsearch/` (re-run after revision `N`).

This command is the optional pre-draft step described in `SKILL.md`. It is a **sibling critic**, not a phase that gates the state machine. The drafter consumes the initial litsearch; the reviser consumes any re-run litsearch alongside `.review/` and `.audit/`.

## Why this is a separate role

Folding literature search into the drafter conflates two distinct failure modes:

- The drafter may write good prose around bad citations.
- The drafter may write bad prose around good citations.

Separating litsearch lets each role do one job. It also lets the reviser **re-run** litsearch when the reviewer points out a gap in related work, without re-drafting the paper — the next revision picks up the new litsearch sibling and updates the related-work section specifically.

## Critical constraint: do not invent citations

Pure-LLM literature search hallucinates citations. This role MUST NOT invent BibTeX entries from training-data recall. The only entries allowed in `candidates.bib` are:

1. Entries from `<thread>/refs.bib` (re-formatted for consistency if the author's `.bib` had issues).
2. Entries from `<thread>/refs/` source material the author explicitly supplied (e.g., a Semantic Scholar export, a `.bib` file dumped from Zotero, a list of titles + authors + venues + years in `BRIEF.md`).
3. Entries the brief explicitly mentions (e.g., the brief says "compare against Smith et al. 2024, arXiv:2405.12345 — full BibTeX in refs/"). The role copies/formats — it does not autocomplete.

If the brief or the reviewer's comments say "there should be related work on X" and no source material exists on disk, the role surfaces the gap in `notes.md` for the author to fill manually (e.g., by running their own search tool and adding to `<thread>/refs/`). The role does NOT invent a plausible-sounding Smith et al. 2024.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Brief** (`<thread>/BRIEF.md`): freeform prose with optional YAML frontmatter. Recognized frontmatter keys include `claim_area`, `closest_prior_work`, `venue`. Unrecognized keys are passed through as context.
- **Reference material** (`<thread>/refs/**`): any supporting material the author has supplied. Treated as read-only context.
- **Existing bibliography** (`<thread>/refs.bib`): if the author has started a bibliography, re-use it as the basis for `candidates.bib`.
- **Re-run context** (re-run path only): the latest `<thread>.{N}/main.tex` (to understand current positioning) and `<thread>.{N}.review/comments.md` entries tagged `related-work` or `blocker:related-work`.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.0.litsearch/                (initial; or <thread>.{N}.litsearch/ for re-runs)
  notes.md             Positioning narrative + gaps the author should fill
  candidates.bib       Candidate BibTeX entries (re-formatted from author-supplied sources only)
  _progress.json       Phase state (phase: litsearch)
```

### `notes.md` structure

- **Positioning summary** (3–5 paragraphs): how the paper's claim relates to the supplied prior work. For each cluster of prior work, name the cluster, identify the closest 1–3 papers (with `\citetentry`-style references back to `candidates.bib`), and state how the paper extends / contradicts / complements it.
- **Confirmed coverage**: bullet list of related-work areas the supplied references cover adequately.
- **Identified gaps**: bullet list of areas where the brief or the drafter would clearly benefit from additional citations but none were supplied. Each gap names the area precisely enough that the author can search for it ("recent results on noise robustness in transformer architectures, ~2023–2025"). **The role does not invent placeholder entries to fill these gaps** — it names the gap and stops.
- **Re-run delta** (re-run path only): a short paragraph naming what changed since the previous litsearch (which review comments drove the re-run, which gaps were closed by author-supplied additions, which remain open).

### `candidates.bib`

A valid BibTeX file with one entry per cited paper. Entries follow standard BibTeX field conventions:

```bibtex
@inproceedings{smith2024example,
  author    = {Smith, Jane and Jones, Carol},
  title     = {An Example Paper Title},
  booktitle = {Proceedings of the Example Conference},
  year      = {2024},
}
```

The drafter is free to merge entries from `candidates.bib` into the version dir's `refs.bib`. Entries the drafter does not cite remain in `candidates.bib` only and do not pollute the final bibliography.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: enumerate `<thread>.*.litsearch/` siblings. If invoked without explicit version context, default to creating `<thread>.0.litsearch/` (the pre-draft sibling). If the latest version dir is `<thread>.{N}/` and the user (or orchestrator) requested a re-run, create `<thread>.{N}.litsearch/`.
2. **Resume check**: if the target litsearch dir's `_progress.json.litsearch.state == done` AND `notes.md` + `candidates.bib` exist, exit early — the sibling is complete.
3. **Initialize `_progress.json`**: `phases.litsearch.state = in_progress`, `phases.litsearch.started = <ISO>`.
4. **Read inputs**: load `BRIEF.md`, enumerate `<thread>/refs/`, load `<thread>/refs.bib` if present. On re-run, also load `<thread>.{N}/main.tex` and `<thread>.{N}.review/comments.md`.
5. **Build `candidates.bib`**: re-format author-supplied entries; do not invent. If the brief lists papers by title only, leave a `% TODO: needs BibTeX fields` comment per missing entry and surface in `notes.md` gaps.
6. **Write `notes.md`**: positioning narrative + confirmed coverage + identified gaps + (re-run only) delta paragraph.
7. **Update `_progress.json`**: `phases.litsearch.state = done`, `phases.litsearch.completed = <ISO>`.
8. **Report**: print the path to the litsearch sibling and a one-line status (e.g., `Litsearch q3-method.0.litsearch/ (12 candidates, 3 gaps surfaced)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

- A completed litsearch (`litsearch.state == done` AND `notes.md` + `candidates.bib` exist) is never re-run automatically. Re-invoking creates a NEW sibling at the next version (`<thread>.{N+1}.litsearch/`) only if the user/orchestrator requests it; otherwise it is a no-op with a notice.
- A crashed litsearch is re-runnable after deleting partial output.

## `_progress.json` snippet

This command writes the critic-sibling shape documented in `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md`. Litsearch siblings live at `<thread>.0.litsearch/` (pre-draft) or `<thread>.{N}.litsearch/` (re-run after reviewer feedback):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "thread": "<slug>",
  "for_version": 0,
  "phases": {
    "litsearch": { "state": "done", "started": "<ISO>", "completed": "<ISO>" }
  }
}
```

`for_version: 0` for the pre-draft sibling; `for_version: <N>` for re-runs at version `N`. Merge rule (shallow): preserve fields not touched by this command. Use ISO-8601 UTC timestamps per `anvil/lib/snippets/timestamp.md`.

Litsearch outputs (`notes.md` + `candidates.bib`) are a domain-specific scorecard; the sibling SHOULD declare `scorecard_kind: human-verdict` in `_meta.json` per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` (the drafter reads the notes narratively, not as a programmatic per-dimension partial scorecard).
