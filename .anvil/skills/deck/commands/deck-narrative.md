# deck-narrative — Narrative-arc critic

**Role**: narrative-arc critic.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/deck.md` (full read, in slide order) + `speaker-notes.md` + `<thread>/BRIEF.md`.
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.narrative/` with `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `comments.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`.

This critic evaluates the deck as a **single story** rather than slide-by-slide. The other critics look at individual slides; this critic asks whether the slides cohere into an argument that ends in an ask.

## Owned rubric dimensions

- **1 — Narrative arc** (weight 6) — the deck flows from problem → solution → why-now → why-us → ask as a single argument.
- **7 — Ask specificity** (weight 5) — round size, use of funds, runway-to-milestone are concrete and follow from the setup.

Total ownership: 11/40 (the highest-leverage 11 points in the rubric).

Other rubric dimensions are scored by other critics and remain `null` in this critic's `_summary.md`.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/deck.md`.
- **Brief**: `<thread>/BRIEF.md` (to verify the deck's ask matches the brief's ask).
- **Optional rubric override**: `.anvil/skills/deck/rubric.overrides.md`.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.narrative/
  _summary.md       8-dim partial scorecard (dims 1 + 7 scored; others null) + critical-flag bool
  findings.md       Itemized findings (severity, slide ref or sequence ref, rationale, suggested fix)
  comments.md       Sequence-level commentary (transitions, missing bridges, slide-order issues)
  _meta.json        { "critic": "narrative", "role": "deck-narrative.md", ... }
  _progress.json    Phase state for this critic
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the narrative sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The five files (`_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `comments.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.narrative.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.narrative/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.narrative.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/deck.md`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.narrative.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed critic session (issue #350). If `<thread>.{N}.narrative/` exists (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete), exit early (idempotent).
2. **Resume check**: per the staged-sidecar shape introduced in issue #350, a partial narrative critic left behind by a mid-cycle interrupt manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.narrative.tmp/` directory; the step 1 sweep has already removed it. Backwards-compat: if a legacy pre-#350 `<thread>.{N}.narrative/` exists WITHOUT `_summary.md`, delete the dir and re-run.
3. **Open the staged sidecar** for the narrative dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.narrative, required_files=["_summary.md", "findings.md", "comments.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write below MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.narrative.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.narrative/` path. On clean context exit, the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name (issue #350). Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json` and `_meta.json`.
4. **Read deck.md end-to-end** as one document. Read speaker-notes.md in parallel. Read BRIEF.md for the canonical ask.
5. **Evaluate narrative arc** (Dim 1, weight 6):
   - **Problem → Solution bridge**: Does the solution slide answer the problem slide? If the solution describes a different problem, score low.
   - **Solution → Why-now**: Why is now the right time? Is there a credible reason (technology unlock, regulatory change, behavior change)? "Why now" missing or weak = score ≤3.
   - **Why-now → Why-us**: Why is this team right for this moment? Is the founder–market fit explicit?
   - **Why-us → Traction/Proof**: Does the team's claim get backed by evidence? If team claims "we're the experts" but traction is thin, the arc breaks.
   - **Traction → Ask**: Does the ask follow from the setup? If the ask is "$3M to validate the problem" but the problem slide claimed product-market fit, the arc breaks.
   - **Slide order**: Are slides in an order that builds the argument? Out-of-order slides (e.g., team before problem) almost always score low.
   - **Slide count**: Target 10–15 for fundraising decks. Decks <8 slides usually feel thin; decks >18 usually feel padded. Flag deviation but don't auto-deduct — some stages legitimately need more (e.g., growth rounds with extensive financials).
6. **Evaluate ask specificity** (Dim 7, weight 5):
   - Round size present and specific? ("$3M", not "raising a round").
   - Use of funds broken down? (engineering / GTM / hires / runway, with rough percentages or dollar amounts).
   - Runway-to-milestone framing? ("$3M gets us to $5M ARR over 18 months", not just "$3M for 18 months runway").
   - Does the ask in deck.md match the ask in BRIEF.md? If not, flag — drafter or brief is out of sync.
   - **Critical flag — `Absent ask`**: trigger if any of round size / use of funds / runway-to-milestone is missing entirely, OR if the ask is so vague it gives the investor permission to say "interesting, keep me posted."
7. **Identify additional findings**:
   - Missing logical bridges between slides (specific examples).
   - Slides that don't earn their place (could be cut without weakening the argument).
   - Slides that should be added (e.g., missing competitive-positioning slide makes the differentiation claim float).
   - Speaker-notes that contradict slide content (a sign the drafter is hedging).
   - Stubs and TODOs left over from the draft (e.g., `[TODO: traction number from brief]`).
8. **Write `_summary.md`**:
   ```markdown
   # Narrative critic summary

   ```json
   {
     "critic": "narrative",
     "for_version": <N>,
     "dimensions": {
       "1_narrative_arc":            { "score": 5, "weight": 6 },
       "2_problem_clarity":          null,
       "3_market_size_credibility":  null,
       "4_solution_differentiation": null,
       "5_traction_proof":           null,
       "6_team_credibility":         null,
       "7_ask_specificity":          { "score": 4, "weight": 5 },
       "8_design_polish":            null
     },
     "critical_flag": false,
     "critical_flag_notes": []
   }
   ```
   ```
9. **Write `findings.md`**:
   ```
   ## Findings (narrative)

   1. **[major]** Slide 3 → 4: Why-now claim ("AI agents are mature enough") not connected to the solution. Suggested fix: add a sentence to Slide 4 explicitly using AI-agent capability that wouldn't have existed 18 months ago.
   2. **[minor]** Slide 10 (Team) sits between Business model (Slide 9) and Financials (Slide 11); the team intro lands cold after a pricing table. Suggested fix: add a transitional speaker-notes line ("having shown how revenue works, here is the team that will execute it") rather than reordering — Team's canonical slot is Slide 10.
   3. **[major]** Slide 12 (Ask): "Raising $3M" but no breakdown. Suggested fix: add use-of-funds bullet (40% eng / 30% GTM / 20% hires / 10% runway) and runway-to-milestone framing.
   ```
10. **Write `comments.md`** (sequence-level, not slide-level):
    ```
    ## Slide order

    The canonical order is: Title → Problem → Why now → Solution → Competition → Product → Market → Traction → Business model → Team → Financials → Ask. This is the order `templates/deck.md.j2` ships and the order this critic grades against.

    Example misorder (illustrative): a deck that opens Title → Team → Problem (leading with founder bios before establishing the problem) almost always reads as a personal pitch rather than a company pitch. The standard fix is to move Team to its canonical slot at Slide 10.

    ## Transitions

    - Slide 2 → 3 (Problem → Why now): strong; the why-now claim names a concrete recent change that opens the window for the problem just stated.
    - Slide 3 → 4 (Why now → Solution): weak; the why-now claim doesn't manifest in the solution description. See finding #1.
    - Slide 10 → 11 (Team → Financials): abrupt; consider a transitional sentence.

    ## Slide count

    12 slides (within target range 10–15). Slide 13 appendix optional and not included; recommend adding 1-2 appendix slides with detailed unit economics for follow-up Q&A.
    ```
11. **Update `_progress.json`** and `_meta.json` inside the staging dir (finished: <ISO>). The `_progress.json` write MUST be the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires it to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies every name in the required-files manifest exists in the staging dir, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.narrative.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.narrative/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.
12. **Report**: one-line status (e.g., `Narrative critic on acme-seed.1 → acme-seed.1.narrative/ (dims 1+7: 9/11; 3 findings)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

Standard: completed = no-op; crashed = re-runnable after deleting partial output.

## Notes for the narrative-critic agent

- **Read the deck linearly, in one pass, like an investor scrolling through a PDF for the first time.** Then read it again, slower. The first pass catches arc problems; the second catches detail.
- **An arc breaks when the conclusion doesn't follow.** "We're raising $3M to build the product" is fine for pre-seed but breaks the arc of a deck that claimed product-market fit on Slide 5.
- **Don't critique design, market math, problem clarity, traction, or team here.** Other critics own those dimensions. Stay in the arc + ask lane. (If you spot a fabrication issue in passing, flag it in `comments.md` as an aside — but score only owned dimensions.)
- **The ask is the test.** A deck that doesn't have a concrete ask isn't a pitch deck; it's a company overview. Score harshly when the ask is missing or vague.


**Scorecard kind declaration**: This critic's `_meta.json` SHOULD include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md`. This is a deck specialist critic — `machine-summary` shape (`_summary.md` + `findings.md`), partial scorecard with non-owned dimensions set to `null`. The deck-review aggregator reads this sibling's `_summary.md` and combines its scores into the composite verdict.
