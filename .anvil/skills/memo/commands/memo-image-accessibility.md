description: Image-accessibility critic for the memo skill (Epic #328 Phase 5). Scans the body markdown of the latest <thread>.{N}/ version dir for missing alt text, inadequate placeholder alt text, and broken image paths; writes a typed _review.json to the <thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/ sibling for the critics aggregator. Optional, non-blocking, idempotent. A11y findings are advisory in v0 — no critical-flag short-circuit.

# memo-image-accessibility — Image-accessibility critic

**Role**: Deterministic tool-evidence critic + optional VLM-assisted alt-text generation (pre-flight detector, optional, non-blocking, advisory).
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md` plus any image files referenced from it (resolved relative to the version dir).
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/_review.json` and `<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/_findings.json` — only when invoked with `--write-review` (opt-in, mirroring the Phase 2 / Phase 3 sibling-critic CLI contract). Default invocation is a pure scan that prints the structured payload to stdout.

This command is the memo-skill analog for Phase 5 of the reframed Epic #328. It runs a deterministic pass over the body markdown and emits a typed `Review` (`kind=tool_evidence`) that the standard `critics.aggregate` pipeline merges into the verdict alongside the standard `memo-review` judgment critic.

**Phase 5 of Epic #328 (reactivated 2026-06-05)**. Hybrid tool-evidence + VLM critic. Three sibling deferred phases ship together (Phase 4 `figure-content`, Phase 5 `image-accessibility`, Phase 6 `claim-figure-grounding`) and all three use the same CLI shape — `python -m anvil.skills.memo.lib.<module> <version_dir> [--write-review]` — per the Phase 2 (#338) precedent.

**State-machine status**: `memo-image-accessibility` is an **optional pre-review pass**, NOT a new state. It runs after `memo-draft` and before the LLM-side `memo-review`; the standard review aggregator picks up the `.image-accessibility/` sibling automatically via `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`. See SKILL.md §"Critic auto-discovery" for the surrounding contract.

**Composability**: independently re-runnable. The consumer can fix an alt attribute, add a missing image file, or run the VLM enrichment offline, then re-invoke `memo-image-accessibility <version_dir>` to regenerate the findings. Each invocation regenerates `_review.json` from the current body + current filesystem state; `<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/_review.json` is a **derived artifact** and MUST NEVER be hand-edited.

## Inputs

- **Version directory** (positional argument): the memo version directory (e.g. `memo/memo.1/`).
- **Body markdown**: `<version_dir>/<thread>.md` per the post-#295 contract (body filename echoes the thread slug).
- **Image files**: referenced from the body via markdown `![alt](path)` or HTML `<img src="...">`; resolved relative to the version dir.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/
  _review.json    Typed Review (kind=tool_evidence) per anvil/lib/review_schema.py.
  _findings.json  Structured payload from ImageAccessibilityResult.to_json() (informational companion).
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): when `--write-review` is set, the image-accessibility sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The two files (`_review.json`, `_findings.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

The `_review.json` carries:

- One null-scored row on dimension `image_accessibility` so the schema validates while the aggregator treats this critic as null-everywhere (same pattern as `render_gate`'s null-scored row on dimension `render_gate`).
- One `Finding` per detected defect (missing alt / inadequate alt / broken path), with severity per the table below.
- **No `CriticalFlag` entries.** A11y is advisory in v0; the aggregator's verdict computes from the standard total + threshold path, not a critical-flag short-circuit.

## Three classes of finding

| Class | Detector | Severity | Default `suggested_fix` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Missing alt** | empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) or no `alt=` attribute at all on `<img>`; `![](path)` with empty alt | `major` | VLM-generated candidate (when callback wired), else a deterministic template asking for a 1-sentence description |
| **Inadequate alt** | literal placeholder (`alt="image"`, `"figure"`, `"chart"`, `"img"`, `"picture"`, `"graphic"`, `"diagram"`); single-word generic prefix without further subject (`"screenshot"`, `"photo"`, `"illustration"`, `"drawing"`, `"icon"`); sub-10-character non-descriptive alt | `minor` | VLM-regenerated candidate (when callback wired), else a deterministic template asking for a 1-sentence replacement |
| **Broken path** | image file does not exist at the resolved path (reuses `memo_image_refs.lint_source` for the determination) | `major` | `propose_edit` with closest-match suggestion via `difflib.get_close_matches` if a similarly-named file exists nearby; `propose_removal` template otherwise |

**Class precedence**. Broken path takes priority over alt-quality: when the file doesn't exist on disk, the alt-quality discussion is moot (the render will fail). A single ref with both `alt=""` AND a broken path emits a single `broken_path` finding.

## Kind-per-finding decision (single sibling, single Kind)

**Choice**: the critic ships as a **single** `<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/` sibling with `kind=Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE` for the entire `Review`. Every emitted `Finding` carries `tool_calls` so the schema validator's per-finding requirement passes:

- **Broken-path findings**: `tool_calls=[]` (no tool invocation — the determination is filesystem-only via `memo_image_refs`).
- **Missing-alt / inadequate-alt findings**: one `ToolCall` entry per finding describing the VLM invocation (model name, image path, whether the callback was invoked or short-circuited via cache/no-callback). The `result_summary` carries the generated candidate, or a sentinel string when the VLM path was not exercised.

**Rejected alternative**: two siblings, one `Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE` for existence + heuristics and one `Kind.VISION` for VLM-generated alt-text. Rejected because `Kind.VISION` requires `rendered_artifact` to be set on the `Review` (one rendered artifact per `Review`), but the image-accessibility critic spans N images per memo (one per reference), each potentially with its own VLM call. The N-images-per-Review shape is a clean fit for `Kind.TOOL_EVIDENCE` (each finding records its own tool call) and a structural mismatch for `Kind.VISION`.

This choice is load-bearing for the test suite — the round-trip through `Review.model_validate` succeeds only because every `Finding` emitted carries `tool_calls` when `kind=tool_evidence`.

## VLM coordination + cost discipline

The critic invokes a Vision-Language-Model via `anvil/lib/vision.py` to generate alt-text candidates for missing-alt and inadequate-alt findings. Cost discipline:

- **OFF by default in the CLI**. The CLI entry point does NOT invoke the VLM; missing/inadequate-alt findings still fire, but their `suggested_fix` carries a deterministic template ("write a 1-2 sentence description of the image content"). This keeps the critic CI-reproducible and offline-safe by default. Programmatic consumers (skill commands invoked from a wrapper) drive the VLM by passing a callback to `scan` / `scan_version_dir` directly.
- **Content-hash cache**. The first VLM call for a given set of image bytes caches its result under `sha256(image_bytes)`; subsequent calls for the same bytes return the cached candidate without re-invoking the VLM. The cache is process-local (an in-process dict), session-lifetime (evicted at process exit). No on-disk persistence — the cache is regenerated on each fresh run, which is fine for the typical operator workflow (re-running the critic across multiple memos in a single session benefits; cross-session re-runs are rare because the operator usually only re-runs after a body edit, which invalidates the relevant subset anyway).
- **Coordination with Phase 4 (#340)**. If the sibling `figure-content` phase lands an `anvil/lib/vision_cache.py` shared cache primitive, this module promotes via a one-line import swap. Per the issue body's coordination note, that promotion is deferred until the second consumer of the cache shape materializes.

## Auto-discovery contract

`<thread>.{N}.image-accessibility/` follows the standard sibling-critic naming convention recognized by `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`. The single-segment tag (`image-accessibility`) contains a hyphen but no dot, so the discovery regex (`<version_dir>.<tag>` where `<tag>` is a single segment without `.`) matches without changes.

The `_review.json` file in the sibling is the load-bearing contract; `_findings.json` is informational and not parsed by the aggregator. No aggregator change is required to wire this critic in. The first invocation of the standard `memo-review` post `memo-image-accessibility` automatically picks up the `.image-accessibility/` sibling and merges its findings into the verdict. The aggregator already treats null-scored dimensions as "this critic does not own this dim" — the `image_accessibility` row contributes 0 to the total score; the load-bearing artifacts are the findings.

## Severity ladder

| Class | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Missing alt (load-bearing figure with screen-reader-invisible content) | `major` | Always emitted unless suppressed via `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_missing_alt -->` |
| Inadequate alt (placeholder / sub-10-char non-descriptive) | `minor` | Always emitted unless suppressed via `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_inadequate_alt -->` |
| Broken path (file does not exist) | `major` | Reuses `memo_image_refs.lint_source` for the determination; closest-match suggestion via `difflib` when a similarly-named file exists nearby |

**No critical flags.** A11y is advisory in v0. Findings are surfaced to the reviewer and the next reviser, but the aggregator's verdict computation does NOT short-circuit on accessibility defects alone.

## Suppression directive

Authors who deliberately ship a memo with an image-accessibility defect (rare; intended for in-progress draft state) can suppress per-line with one of three rule names:

```markdown
<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_missing_alt -->
<img src="exhibits/fig-1.png">

<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_inadequate_alt -->
![chart](exhibits/fig-1.png)

<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_broken_path -->
![figure 1](exhibits/coming-soon.png)
```

Both placements honored (same shape as `memo_image_refs_exist`): same-line directive, or standalone-line directive on the line immediately above the ref. Comma-separated rule lists are honored (`<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_missing_alt, some-other-rule -->`).

## CLI entry point

```bash
python -m anvil.skills.memo.lib.image_accessibility <version_dir> [--write-review] [--body-filename <name>]
```

The `<version_dir>` is the memo version directory (e.g. `memo/memo.1/`). The runner always prints the structured payload (`ImageAccessibilityResult.to_json()`) to stdout. When `--write-review` is passed, it additionally writes `<version_dir>.image-accessibility/_review.json` (typed) and `<version_dir>.image-accessibility/_findings.json` (companion) into the sibling critic dir for auto-discovery by `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`.

**Staged-sidecar wiring** (issue #350; only when `--write-review` is set): on entry, **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<version_dir>`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.image-accessibility.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed session. Then **open the staged sidecar** for the image-accessibility dir by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<version_dir>.image-accessibility, required_files=["_review.json", "_findings.json"])`. Write both files **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<version_dir>.image-accessibility.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<version_dir>.image-accessibility/` path. On clean context exit, the staged sidecar primitive verifies both files exist, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.

**Exit codes** (mirror Phase 2 / Phase 3 sibling-critic CLI contracts):

- `0`: clean scan — zero findings.
- `1`: one or more findings (missing / inadequate / broken).
- `2`: invocation error (missing `version_dir`).

The non-zero-on-findings semantics let CI / shell pipelines branch on the result without parsing the JSON.

**VLM coordination**. The CLI does NOT invoke the VLM. Programmatic consumers that want VLM-generated alt-text candidates pass a callback to `scan` / `scan_version_dir` directly. The CLI default produces deterministic findings with template `suggested_fix` text and `vlm_invoked=False` on every finding.

## Failure modes

All failure modes are **non-blocking** by design:

| Failure | Symptom | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| **Missing version dir** | `version_dir does not exist` | Run `memo-draft` first. |
| **Missing body markdown** | `<version_dir>/<thread>.md` not found | The scan returns an empty `ImageAccessibilityResult`. |
| **Unreadable image file** | VLM callback gets no image bytes; falls back to deterministic template | The finding still surfaces (with template `suggested_fix`). |
| **VLM callback raises** | Defensive catch in `generate_alt_text` returns None | The finding still surfaces (with template `suggested_fix`); the rest of the scan continues. |
| **VLM returns empty string** | Treated as no candidate | The finding surfaces with the deterministic template; the empty result is not cached (so a future fix-and-retry path can re-invoke). |

## Re-run pattern

`memo-image-accessibility` is **idempotent + cheaply re-runnable**:

- **Operator added an alt attribute**: a prior scan flagged `<img src="fig.png">` as missing alt. The operator edits the body to `<img src="fig.png" alt="Revenue by quarter, FY24">`. Re-invoke and the finding clears.
- **Operator added the missing image file**: a prior scan flagged `exhibits/fig-1.png` as broken. The operator copies the file into place. Re-invoke and the broken-path finding clears.
- **Operator suppressed a deliberate placeholder**: a prior scan flagged `![chart](placeholder.png)` as inadequate alt. The operator decides the placeholder is intentional (in-progress draft) and adds `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_accessibility_inadequate_alt -->` on the line above. Re-invoke and the finding clears.

What `memo-image-accessibility` does NOT do:

- **Never edit `<thread>.md`.** The body is the source-of-truth; the critic only reads.
- **Never generate or modify image files.** The critic only reads image bytes for VLM input.
- **Never produce a new version directory.** The critic operates on the existing `<thread>.{N}/`.

## Composability with the standard memo lifecycle

The lifecycle wiring (per Epic #328 Phase 5):

- **`memo-image-accessibility`** can run any time after `memo-draft` writes `<thread>.md`. It is independent of `memo-render` and `memo-review` — operators may run all three in any order.
- **`memo-review`** picks up the `.image-accessibility/` sibling automatically via `critics.discover_critics`. The aggregator merges the `tool_evidence`-kind review into the verdict alongside the standard judgment-kind review.
- **`memo-revise`** consumes findings from the aggregated review (which includes the `.image-accessibility/` findings) and rewrites the body markdown to address them.

There is no required order between `memo-image-accessibility` and the LLM-side `memo-review`. The standard pattern is: `memo-draft` → `memo-image-accessibility` → `memo-review` → `memo-revise`.
