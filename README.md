## 🧭 The Story & Challenge

Imagine a frontier town where **10 houses stand in a circle**, connected by paths that carry not just people, but also the relentless spread of fire. When flames erupt, they leap from house to house with terrifying speed. The townsfolk have formed a **Bucket Brigade** — but not everyone wants to be a hero.

Some are exhausted from long workdays. Others prioritize their own home over the community's needs. A few might even spread false information or work against the group. In this microcosm of human nature, **cooperation isn't guaranteed — it's earned**.

**Bucket Brigade** transforms this dramatic scenario into a research platform where AI agents navigate the complex dance between self-interest and collective good. Every "night," agents make two crucial decisions:

1. **Signal** their intent (work or rest) — but they might be lying
2. **Choose an action**: where to go and whether to fight fires

The result? Endless fascinating dynamics of **trust, deception, coordination, and sacrifice**.

## 🎯 Core Game Mechanics

See [docs/game_mechanics.md](docs/game_mechanics.md) for the complete game rules and mechanics.

## 🎯 Research Goals

- **Run large-scale tournaments** with diverse teams and scenarios (1000+ games)
- **Extract individual policy performance** with statistical validation
- **Evolve optimal heuristic agents** through evolutionary algorithms
- **Train neural network policies** using PufferLib/PPO reinforcement learning
- **Analyze Nash equilibria** to find stable strategic configurations
- **Understand cooperation dynamics** through scenario analysis and agent ranking

## 🎮 Nash Equilibrium Analysis

Find **stable strategic configurations** where no agent can improve by unilaterally changing strategy.

### What is Nash Equilibrium?

In the Bucket Brigade game, a Nash equilibrium represents a strategic configuration where:
- Every agent is playing a best response to others' strategies
- No single agent can improve their payoff by changing their strategy alone
- The system is in a stable state (no incentive to deviate)

### Key Algorithms

1. **Payoff Evaluation** (Monte Carlo)
   - Estimate expected rewards for strategy profiles
   - **Performance**: 100 simulations in ~0.4s (Rust-backed)
   - Uses parallel execution for faster computation

2. **Best Response Computation**
   - Find optimal strategy against given opponents
   - Uses scipy.optimize with bounds and constraints
   - Supports both local (L-BFGS-B) and global (differential evolution) optimization

3. **Double Oracle Algorithm**
   - Iteratively build strategy pool
   - Add best responses until convergence
   - Solves for mixed strategy equilibria

4. **Nash Solver** (Linear Programming)
   - Computes symmetric Nash equilibria
   - Uses scipy linear programming solver
   - Returns probability distribution over strategies

### Usage Example

```bash
# Analyze Nash equilibrium for a specific scenario
uv run python scripts/analyze_nash_equilibrium.py --scenario greedy_neighbor

# With custom parameters
uv run python scripts/analyze_nash_equilibrium.py \
    --scenario early_containment \
    --num-simulations 1000 \
    --max-iterations 10

# Quick test with minimal simulations
uv run python scripts/test_nash_minimal.py
```

### Agent Archetypes

Predefined strategy profiles for testing:
- **Firefighter**: High work tendency, honest signaling
- **Free Rider**: Low work tendency, rest bias
- **Hero**: Extreme work tendency, own house priority
- **Coordinator**: High coordination weight, honest signals
- **Liar**: Dishonest signaling, strategic deception

### Performance

| Operation | Time | Speedup |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 100 simulations | 0.4s | **2250x** faster than Python |
| Payoff matrix (2×2) | ~2s | Enables practical analysis |
| Full Double Oracle | Minutes | Was previously hours/days |

## 🧠 Ranking Orchestration

The **ranking system** runs batches of simulated games to estimate each agent's marginal value.

### Workflow
1. Randomly sample teams and scenarios.
2. Run games via `BucketBrigadeEnv`.
3. Record outcomes (team composition, rewards, replay path).
4. Fit a surrogate model:

   $$
   R_{\text{team}} = \alpha + \sum_{i\in\text{team}} \theta_i + \langle w, \phi_c\rangle + \varepsilon
   $$

5. Rank agents by estimated contribution $\theta_i$.
6. Optionally, adaptively select new team combinations to reduce uncertainty.

All results are logged to a local SQLite database and saved as JSON replays for analysis and visualization.

## 🧵 Development Orchestration

This repository is set up to use **Loom** for AI-powered development orchestration in future development stages. See `LOOM_AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for details on the autonomous Loom agent workflow system (Builder, Judge, Curator, etc.) that will be used for managing complex development tasks like implementing the full Bayesian ranking system and PufferLib integration.

**Note**: The term "agent" in this project refers to two different concepts:
- **Loom Agents** (development): Builder, Judge, Curator - autonomous development workers (see `LOOM_AGENTS.md`)
- **Game Agents** (AI): Firefighter, Hero, Free Rider - AI players in the simulation (see `docs/AGENT_ROSTER.md`)

uv run python scripts/train_policy.py --scenario trivial_cooperation --total-timesteps 500000

# Train with custom opponent mix
uv run python scripts/train_policy.py --scenario early_containment \
    --opponent-policies firefighter coordinator free_rider \
    --run-name my_training_run

# Train on harder scenarios for advanced strategies
uv run python scripts/train_policy.py --scenario chain_reaction \
    --num-opponents 5 --total-timesteps 2000000
```

### Evaluate Trained Policies

    --scenario greedy_neighbor --num-games 100

# Compare against different opponent types
uv run python scripts/evaluate_policy.py models/my_run/best_policy_500000.pt \
    --scenario sparse_heroics --num-opponents 4
```

### Training Features

- **Multi-agent training**: Learn against diverse opponent strategies
- **Scenario curriculum**: Train from easy to hard scenarios
- **Parallel environments**: Efficient training with vectorization
- **Automatic evaluation**: Regular assessment against expert agents
- **Model checkpointing**: Save best models during training

## 🧪 Scenario Testing & Validation

The platform includes **10 carefully designed test scenarios** with known optimal strategies:

- **Trivial Cooperation**: Easy fires reward universal cooperation
- **Early Containment**: Time pressure requires coordinated early action
- **Greedy Neighbor**: Social dilemma between self-interest and helping others
- **Sparse Heroics**: Minimal workers needed, overwork is wasteful
- **Rest Trap**: Usually safe to rest, but occasional disasters require response
- **Chain Reaction**: High spread demands distributed firefighting teams
- **Deceptive Calm**: Honest signaling rewarded during occasional flare-ups
- **Overcrowding**: Too many workers reduce efficiency
- **Mixed Motivation**: House ownership creates conflicting incentives

Each scenario tests different aspects of agent intelligence:
- **Strategic timing** (when to work vs rest)
- **Cooperation incentives** (help others vs focus on self)
- **Resource allocation** (efficient use of limited workers)
- **Honesty vs deception** (signaling and trust dynamics)

Use these scenarios to validate agent learning and ranking accuracy:

```bash
# Test ranking system with known optimal strategies
uv run python scripts/test_scenarios.py trivial_cooperation --num-games 30

# Compare different agent types in challenging scenarios
uv run python scripts/test_scenarios.py chain_reaction --num-games 50
```

## 🤖 Agent Development

### Creating Custom Agents

The platform supports user-submitted agents for research and competition:

```bash
# 1. Create agent template
uv run python scripts/submit_agent.py --create-template

# 2. Implement your strategy in my_agent.py
# Edit the MyCustomAgent class with your logic

# 3. Validate and test your agent
uv run python scripts/submit_agent.py my_agent.py

# 4. Submit for evaluation in tournaments
```

### Agent Interface

Your agent must implement this interface:

```python
class MyAgent(AgentBase):
    def __init__(self, agent_id: int, name: str = "MyAgent"):
        super().__init__(agent_id, name)

    def reset(self):
        # Reset between games
        pass

    def act(self, obs: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray:
        # Return [house_index, mode_flag]
        # obs contains: signals, locations, houses, last_actions, scenario_info
        return np.array([0, 1])  # Example: work on house 0
```

### Security & Validation

- **Sandboxed execution** in isolated environments
- **Static analysis** prevents dangerous code
- **Behavioral testing** validates agent interface
- **Only standard libraries** allowed (numpy, typing, etc.)

### Example Agents

See `bucket_brigade/agents/scenario_optimal/` for examples of optimal strategies for each test scenario.
