# report-claim-figure-grounding — Claim-figure-grounding critic

**Role**: Deterministic tool-evidence critic (pre-flight detector, optional, non-blocking).
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/report.md` plus the on-disk label roster discovered from LaTeX `\label{}` macros, markdown `{#prefix:id}` anchors, and `figures/` / `exhibits/` filenames inside the version directory.
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/_review.json` and `<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/_findings.json` — only when invoked with `--write-review` (opt-in, mirroring the Phase 2 / 3 CLI contracts from issues #335 / #336 and PRs #338 / #337). Default invocation is a pure scan that prints the structured payload to stdout.

This command is the `report`-skill analog of the Phase 2 / 3 Track B detectors shipped under Epic #328 (`hyperlink_resolver`, #335; `citation_coverage`, #336). It runs a deterministic regex sweep over the body markdown and emits a typed `Review` (`kind=tool_evidence`) that the standard `critics.aggregate` pipeline merges into the verdict alongside the standard `report-review` judgment critic.

**Phase 6 of Epic #328 (reframed 2026-06-05)**. Track B mechanical detector — same general shape as #335 / #336 (deterministic detector → `tool_evidence`-kind `_review.json` → sibling critic dir). Picks up the agreed CLI shape `python -m anvil.skills.report.lib.claim_figure_grounding <version_dir> [--write-review]` per the Phase 2 (#338) precedent.

**State-machine status**: `report-claim-figure-grounding` is an **optional pre-review pass**, NOT a new state. It runs after `report-draft` and before the LLM-side `report-review`; the standard review aggregator picks up the `.claim-figure-grounding/` sibling automatically via `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`. See SKILL.md §"Critic auto-discovery" for the surrounding contract.

**Composability**: independently re-runnable. The consumer can add a missing figure to `figures/` / `exhibits/`, fix a typo in the prose label (`Figure 4` → `Figure 3`), and re-invoke `report-claim-figure-grounding <thread>` to re-emit the findings without going through draft / revise. Each invocation regenerates `_review.json` from the current body + current label roster; `<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/_review.json` is a **derived artifact** and MUST NEVER be hand-edited.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument): identifies the thread within the cwd portfolio.
- **Latest version directory**: enumerated from disk as the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/report.md` existing. If no such version exists, exit with a notice (no work to do).
- **Body markdown**: `<thread>.{N}/report.md` per the report skill's Artifact contract (the body filename is fixed at `report.md`; differs from the memo skill's slug-echo `<slug>.md` per #295).
- **Known-label roster**: collected via `anvil/skills/report/lib/claim_figure_grounding.py::collect_known_labels`. The collector walks three ground-truth sources in the version directory:
  1. LaTeX `\label{<prefix>:<id>}` macros in any `.md` / `.tex` / `.latex` file (recursive).
  2. Markdown pandoc-style anchors `{#<prefix>:<id>}` (e.g. `{#fig:adoption-curve}`) in the same text files.
  3. Filenames in the `figures/` and `exhibits/` subdirectories whose stem matches the `<prefix>[-_.]<id>` shape (e.g. `figure-3.png`, `fig_a.svg`, `table-2.md`, `chart-1-2.pdf`).

The prefix vocabulary maps `fig` / `figure` → `Figure`, `tab` / `table` → `Table`, `chart` → `Chart`. Unrecognized prefixes (e.g. `\label{sec:intro}`) are silently ignored — only figure / table / chart labels feed the roster.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/
  _review.json    Typed Review (kind=tool_evidence) per anvil/lib/review_schema.py.
  _findings.json  Structured payload from GroundingResult.to_json() (informational companion).
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): when `--write-review` is set, the claim-figure-grounding sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The two files (`_review.json`, `_findings.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

The `_review.json` carries:

- One null-scored row on dimension `claim_figure_grounding` so the schema validates while the aggregator treats this critic as null-everywhere (same pattern as the memo-side `citation_coverage` and `hyperlink_resolver` siblings).
- One `Finding` per **deduplicated missing label** with severity `major`. The dedupe key is `(label_class, label_id)` — multiple prose references to the same missing label produce one finding; the rationale notes the additional-reference count.
- A free-form `suggested_fix` string composed from the closest-match suggestion (re-number when a near label exists) or the "add or remove" fallback.
- One `CriticalFlag` of type `critical_promised_figure_missing` when any missing label is detected (the issue body's "Critical flag on any non-existent reference" contract).

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: enumerate `<thread>.{N}/` dirs; pick the highest `N` with `report.md` present. If no such version exists, exit with a notice (`No report version found; nothing to scan.`). When `--write-review` is set, **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.claim-figure-grounding.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed session (issue #350).
2. **Invoke the claim-figure-grounding scan**: call

   ```python
   from anvil.skills.report.lib.claim_figure_grounding import scan_version_dir

   result = scan_version_dir(version_dir=<thread>.{N}/)
   ```

   The scanner owns the full pipeline: label-roster collection (per `collect_known_labels`), the three prose-detection regex classes (prepositional / subject-verb / parenthetical), the deduplication on `(label_class, label_id)`, and the closest-match suggestion. See `anvil/skills/report/lib/claim_figure_grounding.py` module docstring for the full detection contract.

3. **Emit `_review.json` + `_findings.json` companion via the staged sidecar** (only when `--write-review` is set): **open the staged sidecar** for the claim-figure-grounding dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding, required_files=["_review.json", "_findings.json"])`. Inside the yielded staging directory (the path of the shape `.<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding.tmp/`), write the typed review and the structured companion:

   ```python
   review = result.to_review(version_dir=<version_dir>.name)
   (staging / "_review.json").write_text(review.model_dump_json(indent=2))
   (staging / "_findings.json").write_text(json.dumps(result.to_json(), indent=2))
   ```

   The review's `kind=tool_evidence` shape is what the aggregator routes on; `tool_calls=[]` is set on every finding to satisfy the schema requirement (the detector greps the body — no per-finding tool invocations to record). The `_findings.json` companion carries `known_labels`, per-reference source spans, the `total_findings` count, and the `critical_flag_emitted` boolean — informational only; the load-bearing contract remains `_review.json`. On clean context exit, the staged sidecar primitive verifies both files exist, then atomically renames `.<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding.tmp/` → `<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding/` (issue #350). The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.

4. (removed — folded into step 3 under the staged-sidecar wrapper.)

5. **Status output**: print a one-line status reflecting the scan outcome:
   - Clean: `Scanned acme-q2/findings.2/report.md (0 missing figures; 7 known labels in roster).`
   - Findings: `Scanned acme-q2/findings.2/report.md (3 missing figures — see _review.json — CRITICAL flag raised).`

## Detection classes (prose regexes)

The detector recognizes three prose shapes for figure/table/chart references:

| Class | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Prepositional** | `see Figure 3`, `as shown in Chart B`, `per Table 2`, `in Figure 3.1` | Leading prep word + class word + label id. Most common shape in customer-facing prose. |
| **Subject-verb** | `Figure 3 illustrates …`, `Table 2 lists …`, `Chart 1 shows …` | Class word + id + active verb. Common in body prose introducing a new figure. |
| **Parenthetical** | `… (Figure 3) …`, `… (Table 2) …` | Bare parenthetical class+id. Often inline citation-style. |

Recognized verbs (subject-verb shape): `shows`, `illustrates`, `displays`, `lists`, `presents`, `summarises` / `summarizes`, `breaks down`, `depicts`, `describes`, `captures`, `demonstrates`, `reveals`, `outlines`, `details` (and the `reports` verb — common in "Table 2 reports the breakdown").

Recognized class words: `Figure(s)` / `Fig(s).?` / `Table(s)` / `Tbl(s).?` / `Chart(s)`. Normalized to canonical `Figure` / `Table` / `Chart` in findings.

Recognized id forms: integer (`3`), dotted (`3.1`, `A.2`), and single uppercase letter (`A`, `B`).

## Label validation (ground-truth roster)

A referenced `(label_class, label_id)` is considered grounded when **any** of the following sources contains it:

1. **LaTeX `\label{<prefix>:<id>}` macros** in any text file (`.md`, `.tex`, `.latex`) inside the version dir (recursive). The prefix is normalized: `fig` / `figure` → `Figure`; `tab` / `table` → `Table`; `chart` → `Chart`. A `\label{sec:intro}` is silently ignored.
2. **Markdown pandoc-style anchors `{#<prefix>:<id>}`** on headings or images in any text file. Same prefix normalization.
3. **Files in `figures/` or `exhibits/` subdirectories** whose stem matches `<prefix>[-_.]<id>` (case-insensitive). Internal `-` and `_` separators in the id are normalized to `.` so `figure-3-1.png` grounds `Figure 3.1`.

The roster is the union of all three sources. Auto-discovery is graceful — unreadable files and unrecognized prefixes are silently skipped.

## Closest-match suggestion

When a referenced label is not in the roster, the critic attempts a closest-match suggestion before falling back to "add or remove":

- **Numeric ids** use integer distance: the nearest known id of the same class within distance 2 is suggested. So a referenced `Figure 4` with only `Figure 3` in the roster suggests `Figure 3`; a referenced `Figure 10` with only `Figure 1` in the roster has no suggestion (distance > 2).
- **Alphabetic ids** use `difflib.get_close_matches` with the same 0.6 cutoff as the citation-coverage precedent (PR #337). For single-letter ids this only matches near-typos.
- **Dotted ids** fall back to alphabetic matching on the full string (so `Figure 3.2` suggests `Figure 3.1` if `3.1` is in the roster).

Candidates are restricted to the same `label_class` — suggesting `Figure 3` for a referenced `Table 3` is more confusing than helpful; the class mismatch is the actual defect.

When no candidate clears the cutoff, the `suggested_fix` advises either adding the missing figure (LaTeX `\label{}`, markdown `{#prefix:id}`, or a `figures/` filename) or removing the prose reference.

## Deduplication contract

Per the issue body's "Dedupe by `(label_class, label_id)`" requirement, multiple prose references to the same missing label produce **one** `MissingFigure` finding. The first reference's line + verbatim text anchor the evidence span; subsequent references are summarized as `additional_references: N` in the finding's rationale.

False-positive disciplines (mirror citation-coverage):

- **Quoted material** never fires: blockquote lines (`>` prefix), fenced code blocks (` ``` ` or `~~~`), and inline-backtick spans (`` `like this` ``).
- **Same-line same-(class, id) duplicates** are dropped at detection time so a line like `see Figure 3, and also Figure 3 below` does not produce two references on one line.

## Critical-flag heuristic

The critic emits a top-level `critical_promised_figure_missing` `CriticalFlag` when **any** missing-label finding exists. The justification summarizes the first three missing labels by `(label_class, label_id)`; additional missing labels are summarized as `+N more`.

When the critical flag fires, the standard `critics.aggregate` pipeline forces `Verdict.BLOCK` regardless of total score. The reviser at the next pass MUST either add the promised figure to the version directory or rewrite the prose to drop the reference.

## Auto-discovery contract

`<thread>.{N}.claim-figure-grounding/` follows the standard sibling-critic naming convention recognized by `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`. The `_review.json` file in the sibling is the load-bearing contract; `_findings.json` is informational and not parsed by the aggregator.

No aggregator change is required to wire this critic in. The first invocation of the standard `report-review` post `report-claim-figure-grounding` automatically picks up the `.claim-figure-grounding/` sibling and merges its findings + critical flag into the verdict. The aggregator already treats null-scored dimensions as "this critic does not own this dim" — the `claim_figure_grounding` row contributes 0 to the total score; the load-bearing artifacts are the findings and the critical flag.

## CLI entry point

```bash
python -m anvil.skills.report.lib.claim_figure_grounding <version_dir> [--write-review] [--body-filename <name>]
```

The `<version_dir>` is the report version directory (e.g. `acme-q2/findings.2/`). The runner always prints the structured payload (`GroundingResult.to_json()`) to stdout. When `--write-review` is passed, it additionally writes `<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding/_review.json` (typed) and `<version_dir>.claim-figure-grounding/_findings.json` (companion) into the sibling critic dir for auto-discovery by `anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`.

**Exit codes** (mirror Phase 2 / 3, #335 / #336):

- `0`: clean scan — zero missing-label findings.
- `1`: one or more missing-label findings.
- `2`: invocation error (missing `version_dir`).

The non-zero-on-findings semantics let CI / shell pipelines branch on the result without parsing the JSON.

## Failure modes

All failure modes are **non-blocking** by design. Each is enumerated here so the operator can route on the specific failure:

| Failure | Symptom | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| **Missing version dir** | `version_dir does not exist` | Run `report-draft` first to create the latest version. |
| **Missing body markdown** | `<version_dir>/report.md` not found | The scan returns an empty `GroundingResult` (no findings, no critical flag). The reviewer's standard back-checks will catch the missing body separately. |
| **Empty figures/exhibits dir** | No figure files alongside the body | The scan still runs; every prose figure reference fires as missing (the LaTeX `\label{}` and markdown `{#}` anchor sources can still ground references if present in the body markdown). |
| **Unrecognized label prefix** | `\label{sec:intro}` referenced in prose as `Section intro` | The label is silently ignored (the prefix vocabulary covers `fig` / `figure` / `tab` / `table` / `chart` only). Section / equation / etc. references are out of scope for the v1 critic. |

## Re-run pattern

`report-claim-figure-grounding` is **idempotent + cheaply re-runnable**. The intended re-run scenarios are:

- **Operator added a figure**: a prior scan flagged `Figure 3` as missing. The operator drops `figure-3.png` into `figures/`. Re-invoke `report-claim-figure-grounding <thread>` and the missing-figure finding clears.
- **Operator fixed the prose**: a prior scan flagged `Figure 4` as missing. The operator edits the body markdown to read `Figure 3` (the actual figure that exists). Re-invoke and the finding clears.
- **Operator added a `\label{}`**: a prior scan flagged `Figure A` as missing. The operator adds `\label{fig:A}` to the body LaTeX block at the figure's location. Re-invoke and the finding clears.

What `report-claim-figure-grounding` does NOT do:

- **Never edit `report.md`.** The body is the source-of-truth; the critic only reads.
- **Never edit `figures/` or `exhibits/`.** Figure management is owned by `report-figures` and the operator.
- **Never produce a new version directory.** The critic operates on the existing `<thread>.{N}/`; version advancement is owned by `report-draft` / `report-revise`.

## Composability with the standard report lifecycle

The lifecycle wiring (per Epic #328 Phase 6):

- **`report-claim-figure-grounding`** can run any time after `report-draft` writes `report.md`. It is independent of `report-figures` and `report-review` — operators may run all three in any order.
- **`report-review`** picks up the `.claim-figure-grounding/` sibling automatically via `critics.discover_critics`. The aggregator merges the `tool_evidence`-kind review into the verdict alongside the standard judgment-kind review.
- **`report-revise`** consumes findings from the aggregated review (which includes the `.claim-figure-grounding/` findings) and either adds the missing figure or rewrites the prose to drop the reference.

There is no required order between `report-claim-figure-grounding` and the LLM-side `report-review`. The standard pattern is: `report-draft` → `report-figures` → `report-claim-figure-grounding` → `report-review` → `report-revise`, but operators may invoke the critic on demand to validate a figure addition without re-running the full review.
