  "story": "Fires spread rapidly (β=0.45) with many initial fires (30%) and frequent sparks. Moderate work cost (c=0.7) and moderate extinguish efficiency (κ=0.6) create pressure to spread out and prevent chain reactions. Clustering agents on one fire while neighbors burn leads to cascading failures.",

    "How should agents distribute across multiple simultaneous fires?",
