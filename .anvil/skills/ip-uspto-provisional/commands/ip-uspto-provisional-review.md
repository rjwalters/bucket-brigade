# ip-uspto-provisional-review — General reviewer

**Role**: general reviewer critic.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/` (all of `spec.tex`, `drawings/`, optional `claims.tex`, `_outline.json`) + `<thread>/BRIEF.md`.
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.review/` with `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`.

The review sibling is **read-only once written**. Revisions consume it; they never modify it.

## Rubric dimensions owned (per `rubric.md`)

| # | Dimension | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | Drawings sufficiency & drawing-text correspondence | 5 |
| 6 | Specification completeness | 5 |
| 7 | Formal compliance (provisional posture) | 3 |
| 8 | Terminology & reference-numeral consistency | 3 |
| 9 | Conversion readiness (joint with `s112`) | 6 |

The reviewer MAY contribute a non-owned score when it has a specific observation (it participates in the mean); otherwise dims 1, 2, 3, 5 stay `null` — the `s112` and `priorart` critics own them.

**Atomicity** (issues #350, #376): written atomically via `anvil/lib/sidecar.py` — files staged under `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/`, atomically renamed on clean completion; stale staging from a prior interrupt of THIS critic removed by `cleanup_one_staging(<thread>.{N}.review)` at entry; sibling critics' staging dirs never touched.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state, sweep, open sidecar**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex`; run `cleanup_one_staging(<thread>.{N}.review)`; if `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists, exit early (idempotent). Otherwise open `staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.review, required_files=["_summary.md", "findings.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])` and write everything inside the staging dir. Initialize `_progress.json` and `_meta.json` with `scorecard_kind: "machine-summary"`, **`rubric_id: "anvil-ip-provisional-v1"`, `rubric_total: 45`, `advance_threshold: 39`** (per-review version stamping, issue #346). Load `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json` when present and cache `prior_rubric_id` for the `_summary.md` rubric block (omit on first iteration).
2. **Read inputs**: all of `<thread>.{N}/`, `BRIEF.md`, `rubric.md`, plus any consumer `.anvil/skills/ip-uspto-provisional/rubric.overrides.md` (additive only). Consult `_outline.json` as the structural ground truth (figure list, feature subsection plan, optional `claim-seed` tree) — a reading aid, not a scored artifact.
2b. **Quoted-evidence requirement (issue #464 / #475 — prose rule)**: each scored dimension's justification string in the `_summary.md` JSON scorecard (D4 / D6 / D7 / D8 / D9 below) MUST embed at least one **verbatim quote from `spec.tex`**, wrapped in inline double quotes and followed by a location anchor — `("the quoted span" — ¶[0042])` — per `anvil/lib/snippets/rubric.md` §"Dimension scoring guidance" rule 1. A dim scored at **full weight** MAY substitute the by-absence marker `no instance of <X> found`; below ceiling the quote requirement stands. **Elision with `...` / `…` is permitted** (issue #478): a quote may skip intervening text with an ellipsis, provided each elided fragment is itself verbatim, ≥ `MIN_QUOTE_CHARS` normalized chars, in document order, and drawn from one nearby passage (within the verifier's `ELISION_WINDOW_CHARS` proximity window) — do NOT stitch fragments from distant sections into one quote. Em/en dashes may be typed as `--` / `---` (the verifier folds dash variants symmetrically). The deterministic write-time self-check is wired at step 9b below (issue #496): `anvil/lib/evidence_check.py` now parses the `scorecard_kind: machine-summary` JSON `dimensions` block in `_summary.md` via the same classifier the table-shaped reviewers use, so the quote rule is enforced deterministically, not prose-only. **D9 is `/6`** — the parser reads the per-dim `weight` from the JSON `dimensions` block so the by-absence ceiling (`score == weight`) applies correctly at 6/6.
3. **Dimension 4 — drawings sufficiency & correspondence (0–5)**:
   - Does every feature whose understanding requires a figure have one (rendered or stub in `drawing-descriptions.md`)?
   - Every `\refnum{N}` in spec appears in a drawing/stub; every numeral in drawings/stubs appears in spec; brief-description-of-drawings lists every figure; captions consistent.
4. **Dimension 6 — specification completeness (0–5)**: Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of Drawings, Detailed Description present and proportionate; every `BRIEF.md` §3 feature reaches the detailed description; §6 edge cases acknowledged. Completeness ≠ length.
5. **Dimension 7 — formal compliance, provisional posture (0–3)**: title and inventor names present (cover-sheet inputs); spec compiles legibly under `anvil-uspto.cls` (class copied alongside); paragraph numbering used consistently IF used at all. **Do NOT apply non-provisional rules** — no abstract word cap, no claim numbering/count rules, no 37 CFR 1.77(b) section-order enforcement; their absence is not a deduction.
6. **Dimension 8 — terminology & reference-numeral consistency (0–3)**: one name per component used consistently across spec and drawings (a component that is "the controller" in ¶[0012] and "the processing unit" in ¶[0031] is a deduction); numerals stable and non-colliding. This is antecedent-basis groundwork for the conversion's claims.
7. **Dimension 9 — conversion readiness, drafting half (0–6, joint with `s112`)**: is each inventive feature articulated sharply enough to draft claims from — load-bearing elements individually named, narrower fallbacks visible? **Claims-optional posture**: absence of `claims.tex` is never a finding or deduction — score from the spec's articulation alone. When a claim-seed is present, well-supported seeds raise the ceiling; seed-internal drafting defects cap at `major`.
8. **Reviewer-level critical flags** (rare): spec so disorganized or internally contradictory it cannot serve as a §119(e) priority document for the invention in the brief; drawings contradicting the spec in a way that undermines the disclosure.
9. **Write `_summary.md`**: full 9-row scorecard (4/6/7/8/9 scored, others `null` with `n/a — see <owning critic>`), top-level rubric block:

   ```json
   {
     "critic": "review",
     "for_version": <N>,
     "rubric": { "id": "anvil-ip-provisional-v1", "total": 45, "advance_threshold": 39, "dimensions": 9 },
     "dimensions": { /* 9-dim partial scorecard */ },
     "critical_flag": false
   }
   ```

   Include `prior_rubric_id` in the rubric block when a prior review sibling exists (this skill ships post-#346, so the steady state is the same id; the field exists for future rubric migrations). The block is observational — it does not affect the verdict.
9b. **Validate quoted evidence (deterministic, write-time self-check)** — issue #464 / #475 / #496:
   - After the `_summary.md` write lands inside the staging dir, invoke `python -m anvil.lib.evidence_check <thread>.{N}/ --scoring <staging dir>/_summary.md` (or call `anvil.lib.evidence_check::check_version_dir(<thread>.{N}/, scoring=<staging dir>/_summary.md)` directly). Because the `--scoring` target is a `_summary.md`, the verifier routes to the machine-summary parser (`parse_machine_summary_dimensions`), reads the JSON `dimensions` block, extracts the quoted spans from each scored dimension's `justification`, and checks each against `spec.tex` (curly→straight quote folding, dash-variant folding, whitespace collapse, markdown-emphasis stripping; case-sensitive substring match, with `...`/`…`-elided spans matched fragment-by-fragment within the `ELISION_WINDOW_CHARS` proximity window — issue #478). This is the SAME classifier the table-shaped reviewers run (only the parser differs); the parser reads each dim's `weight` from the JSON so **D9's `/6` ceiling-by-absence** resolves correctly. Classification per justification: ≥1 span matching the body → pass; score at full weight + `no instance of <X> found` marker → pass; spans present but none matching → **major `fabricated_evidence` finding**; no spans → minor `missing_evidence` advisory. `null`-score (un-owned) dimensions are skipped. Anchors are NOT validated.
   - **Findings are a write-time self-check failure — correct before the sidecar lands**: a `missing_evidence` finding means the reviewer adds the verbatim quote + anchor (or, at full weight, the by-absence marker) to that dimension's `justification` and re-runs the check; a `fabricated_evidence` finding means the reviewer MUST re-derive that justification from the actual `spec.tex` text (re-read, re-quote verbatim, reconsider the score). The staged sidecar MUST NOT exit the context block while `fabricated_evidence` findings persist.
   - **Advisory boundary**: this self-check governs the reviewer's OWN staging-dir `_summary.md` only — it does NOT gate the verdict or `advance` aggregation, does NOT write a sidecar, and is NEVER run retroactively against existing review dirs (legacy siblings are immutable; the rule applies to NEW reviews only).
10. **Write `findings.md`** grouped by dimension; terse and actionable (long-form justification lives in `_summary.md`).
11. **Finalize `_meta.json` + `_progress.json`** inside the staging dir (`_progress.json` LAST), then exit the `staged_sidecar` block — manifest verified, staging dir atomically renamed to `<thread>.{N}.review/`.
12. **Report**: e.g., `Reviewed acme-widget-prov.1 → acme-widget-prov.1.review/ (D4=4/5, D6=4/5, D7=3/3, D8=2/3, D9=4/6; no critical flag)`.

**Score-history note** (issue #346): this critic does NOT write `score_history` — the reviser appends one row per completed critic pass (it is the component that computes the cross-critic aggregate), shape `{ "iteration": <N>, "total": <aggregate>, "threshold": 39, "rubric_id": "anvil-ip-provisional-v1" }` per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Convergence fields". See `ip-uspto-provisional-revise.md` step 6.

## Idempotence and resumability

Standard: completed review never re-run; crashed review re-runnable (the entry sweep removes the stale staging dir); validation by file existence.

## Notes for the reviewer agent

- **Drawing correspondence is mechanical but high-leverage** — orphan numerals on either side are the most common first-draft issue.
- **Hold the provisional posture firmly.** Reflexively applying non-provisional formality rules (abstract caps, claim numbering) produces noise findings the reviser must waste an iteration declining.
- **Terminology drift is cheap to fix now and expensive at conversion.** Flag every synonym pair.

## `_progress.json` snippet

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "thread": "<slug>",
  "for_version": <N>,
  "phases": { "review": { "state": "done", "started": "<ISO>", "completed": "<ISO>" } }
}
```

## Scorecard kind

This critic emits the `machine-summary` scorecard kind per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md`. `_meta.json` MUST include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` plus the three rubric-stamping fields (`"rubric_id": "anvil-ip-provisional-v1"`, `"rubric_total": 45`, `"advance_threshold": 39`).

## Git sync (opt-in, off by default)

Per `anvil/lib/snippets/git_sync.md` (`.anvil/lib/snippets/git_sync.md` in an installed consumer repo): if `.anvil/config.json` exists and `git.commit_per_phase` is `true`, end this phase: stage only the dirs this phase wrote, commit as `anvil(<skill>/<phase>): <thread>.{N} [<state>]`, push if `git.push` is `true`. Git failures warn and continue — never fail the phase. When the config or knob is absent, skip this step entirely (default off).

This phase's specifics:

- **Ordering**: after the staged-sidecar atomic rename (issue #350) lands the final-named `<thread>.{N}.review/` — so only complete sidecars are ever committed.
- **Staging target**: ONLY this command's own `<thread>.{N}.review/` sidecar (never sibling critics' dirs — the narrow scope keeps the hook safe under parallel critic fan-out).
- **Commit**: `anvil(ip-uspto-provisional/review): <thread>.{N} [<state>]` — the bracket carries the thread's derived state per SKILL.md §State machine (`REVIEWED` once all configured critic siblings at `N` are done).
