# ip-uspto-pre-flight — Pre-flight (mechanical compliance)

**Role**: pre-flight checker.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/` (all of `spec.tex`, `claims.tex`, `abstract.txt`, `drawings/`).
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.preflight/` with `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`.

This command catches mechanical formal-compliance issues (37 CFR 1.71–1.84 derived) that critics would otherwise spend their attention budget on. Deterministic checks run first; an LLM fallback handles only the genuinely ambiguous structural cases (e.g., "does this claim look like a multiple-dependent-on-multiple-dependent claim?").

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex` AND `<thread>.{N}/claims.tex`.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.preflight/
  _summary.md        Pass/fail boolean + counts table + per-check status
  findings.md        Itemized findings for any failed check (severity, location, rationale, suggested fix)
  _meta.json         { critic: "preflight", role: "ip-uspto-pre-flight.md", started, finished, model, schema_version, scorecard_kind: "machine-summary" }
  _progress.json     Phase state for the pre-flight check
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the preflight sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The four files (`_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.preflight.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.preflight/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.preflight.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex` AND `<thread>.{N}/claims.tex`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.preflight.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed preflight session (issue #350). If `<thread>.{N}.preflight/` exists (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete), exit early (idempotent).
2. **Resume check**: per the staged-sidecar shape introduced in issue #350, a partial preflight left behind by a mid-cycle interrupt manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.preflight.tmp/` directory; the step 1 sweep has already removed it. Backwards-compat: if a legacy pre-#350 `<thread>.{N}.preflight/` exists without `_summary.md`, delete and re-run.
3. **Open the staged sidecar** for the preflight dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.preflight, required_files=["_summary.md", "findings.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write below MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.preflight.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.preflight/` path. On clean context exit, the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name (issue #350). Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json` for the preflight dir.
4. **Run deterministic checks** (in order; collect findings, do not short-circuit):

   ### Check 1 — Paragraph numbering (`[0001]`, `[0002]`, …)
   - Scan `spec.tex` for `\anvilpara{...}` macro invocations (provided by `anvil-uspto.cls`).
   - Verify the resulting numbering is contiguous starting at `[0001]`. Gaps and duplicates are findings.
   - **Deterministic**: regex + counter.

   ### Check 2 — Abstract word count (≤150 words, 37 CFR 1.72(b))
   - Read `abstract.txt`. Count words (whitespace-separated tokens, exclude pure-punctuation tokens).
   - If count > 150 → finding with severity `blocker`.
   - If count < 50 → finding with severity `minor` (abstract is suspiciously short).
   - **Deterministic**: word count.

   ### Check 3 — Claim numbering (1..N contiguous, 37 CFR 1.126)
   - Parse `claims.tex` for `\begin{claim}...\end{claim}` blocks.
   - Verify each claim is numbered (via the class's auto-numbering, but the source must have one `\begin{claim}` per claim) starting at 1 and contiguous to N.
   - Find any duplicated numbers or gaps.
   - **Deterministic**: parser.

   ### Check 4 — Multiple-dependent claim rule (37 CFR 1.75(c))
   - For each dependent claim, extract its dependency list (e.g., `The widget of claim 1` or `The widget of any one of claims 1 to 3`).
   - **No multiple-dependent claim may depend on another multiple-dependent claim.**
   - **Deterministic** for the unambiguous cases (clear "any of" wording). **LLM fallback** when the dependency phrasing is unconventional (e.g., embedded in prose).
   - Findings: list each violating chain.

   ### Check 5 — Reference numeral coherence
   - Extract every numeric reference (`\refnum{42}` macro or bare `42` in figure captions) from `spec.tex` and `drawings/**`.
   - Verify each reference numeral that appears in `spec.tex` also appears in at least one drawing, and vice versa.
   - Findings: orphan numerals on either side.
   - **Deterministic**: set difference. (Owns Dimension 7 partially; full responsibility is the `review` critic.)

   ### Check 6 — Section heading presence (37 CFR 1.77(b))
   - Verify `spec.tex` contains, in order, the required heading commands provided by `anvil-uspto.cls`:
     - `\fieldoftheinvention`
     - `\background`
     - `\summary`
     - `\briefdescriptionofdrawings`
     - `\detaileddescription`
     - `\claims`
     - `\abstract`
   - Missing or out-of-order headings are findings with severity `blocker`.
   - **Deterministic**: regex.

   ### Check 7 — Page geometry sanity (string-presence check)
   - Verify `spec.tex` *references* `\documentclass{anvil-uspto}` (or a clearly identified consumer override) on the documentclass line.
   - The class, when loaded by `pdflatex`, enforces 1-inch margins, US Letter, 12pt, 1.5 spacing. If the class is not even referenced in the source, raise a finding with severity `blocker`.
   - **Scope is intentionally narrow**: this is a regex on the `\documentclass{...}` line, not a verification that `anvil-uspto.cls` actually resolves on the LaTeX `TEXINPUTS` path. A typo in the class name or a missing/wrong class declaration is caught here; a present-and-correct declaration that nonetheless fails to find the class file at compile time is caught by **Check 9 (render-gate)**, which runs `pdflatex` and surfaces `Class \`anvil-uspto' not found` / `File \`anvil-uspto.cls' not found` as a `blocker` finding.
   - Together: Check 7 is the cheap source-side check (no LaTeX needed) that catches missing or wrong declarations early; Check 9 is the compile-time check that catches class-file resolution failures (bad `TEXINPUTS`, missing class file in the install layout). Both are required — neither subsumes the other.
   - **Deterministic**: regex on documentclass line.

   ### Check 8 — Claim count thresholds
   - Count total claims and independent claims.
   - USPTO charges fees beyond 20 total claims and 3 independent claims (37 CFR 1.16(h)–(j)). NOT a compliance failure but a cost-budget signal.
   - Findings: severity `minor` if total > 20 or independents > 3 (informational).

   ### Check 9 — Render-gate (compile + overfull + placeholders)
   - Invoke `anvil/lib/render_gate.py`'s `compile_and_gate(...)` against `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex` with `engine="pdflatex"`. The gate runs four deterministic sub-checks: page count (`page_cap=None` — patents are uncapped), overfull boxes (>5.0pt threshold), compile success, and source-side placeholders (`TODO` / `[TBD]` / `(figure)` / `.MISSING` plus the ip-uspto-specific `\refnum{??}` / `\anvilpara{}` patterns supplied via `placeholder_patterns`).
   - **Mechanical / pass-fail**, like Checks 1–8 — does NOT score a rubric dimension. The check produces one or more findings (one per failed sub-check) with severity `blocker`, which step 6's pass/fail rule already short-circuits on. On engine-unavailable (`pdflatex` not on PATH), the gate degrades gracefully with `compile_status="unavailable"` and emits a `minor` finding (not a blocker) — pre-flight still passes on CI without LaTeX so the rest of the pipeline remains usable.
   - Write the `GateResult.to_json()` payload to `<thread>.{N}.preflight/_gate.json` for CI inspection alongside `_summary.md` / `findings.md`.

5. **LLM fallback (only when triggered by Check 4)**: if any dependency phrasing was unparseable by the deterministic check, hand the dependent claim text to an LLM with the question: "Does this claim depend on a single antecedent claim, multiple antecedent claims (multiple-dependent), or is it ambiguous?" Use the answer to complete Check 4.
6. **Determine pass/fail**: pass iff no finding has severity `blocker`.
7. **Write `_summary.md`**:

   ```markdown
   ---
   critic: preflight
   for_version: <N>
   passed: <true|false>
   ---

   # Pre-flight summary — <thread>.<N>

   | Check | Result | Findings |
   |---|---|---|
   | 1. Paragraph numbering | pass | - |
   | 2. Abstract word count (≤150) | fail | 1 (count: 168) |
   | 3. Claim numbering contiguous | pass | - |
   | 4. Multiple-dependent claim rule | pass | - |
   | 5. Reference numeral coherence | pass (0 orphans) | - |
   | 6. Section headings | pass | - |
   | 7. Page geometry (anvil-uspto class) | pass | - |
   | 8. Claim count thresholds | informational | 22 total / 4 independent (fee impact) |

   **Overall**: <FAIL — 1 blocker | PASS — informational findings only>

   See `findings.md` for details.
   ```

8. **Write `findings.md`** in the same format as critic findings (severity, location, rationale, suggested fix).
9. **Write `_meta.json`** and finalize `_progress.json` to `done` inside the staging dir. The `_progress.json` write MUST be the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires it to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.preflight.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.preflight/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.
10. **Report**: print the path and a one-line summary (e.g., `Pre-flight: acme-widget.2.preflight/ → FAIL (1 blocker: abstract 168 words)`).

## Gating behavior

The pre-flight result gates the loop edge `REVISED → REVIEWED`:
- If `passed: true`, the orchestrator may advance to running critics on this version.
- If `passed: false`, the operator (or orchestrating agent) must run `ip-uspto-revise` again (with the pre-flight findings included as input) before re-running critics. The orchestrator reports `PRE_FLIGHT_FAILED — revise required`.

## Idempotence

- A completed pre-flight (`_progress.json.preflight.state == done` AND `_summary.md` exists) is never re-run.
- A crashed run is re-runnable after deleting partial output.
- A pre-flight on version `N` is **never re-run** if `<thread>.{N+1}/` already exists — the result was already consumed by a subsequent revision.

## Notes for the pre-flight agent

- **Deterministic first.** Do not invoke the LLM for checks that have unambiguous deterministic implementations. Save the LLM budget for the genuinely ambiguous case (Check 4 fallback).
- **Reference numeral check is partial.** Full reference-numeral correspondence (e.g., "is reference 42 actually depicting the same component everywhere it appears?") is the `review` critic's job. Pre-flight only checks existence/presence.
- **The class file is the enforcement mechanism for geometry.** Pre-flight does not verify geometry directly. Check 7 confirms the source *references* `\documentclass{anvil-uspto}` (a cheap string-presence regex); Check 9 (render-gate) confirms `pdflatex` can actually *resolve and load* the class file from `TEXINPUTS`. Once both checks pass, geometry is correct by construction (the class enforces margins, paper size, font size, and line spacing at compile time).


## Scorecard kind

This critic emits the `machine-summary` scorecard kind per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md`. The `_meta.json` MUST include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` so the `ip-uspto-revise` aggregator can correctly discriminate this sibling from any `human-verdict` siblings (e.g., consumer-added narrative critics).
