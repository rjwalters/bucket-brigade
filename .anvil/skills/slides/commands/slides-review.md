description: Reviewer command for the slides skill. Scores the latest slides version against the 9-dimension /44 rubric, pulls in critical flags from audit and rehearse siblings, and writes a read-only review sibling directory.

# slides-review — Reviewer

**Role**: reviewer.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/` (specifically `deck.md`, all `notes/*.md`, and any `figures/`). Also reads `<thread>.{N}.audit/verdict.md` and `<thread>.{N}.rehearse/timing.md` and `density.md` if present, to propagate critical flags.
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.review/` with `verdict.md`, `scoring.md`, `comments.md`, and `_progress.json`.

The review sibling directory is **read-only once written**. Revisions consume it; they never modify it.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: enumerated from disk as the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/deck.md` existing.
- **Rubric**: `anvil/skills/slides/rubric.md` (9 dimensions, /44, ≥35 threshold, three critical-flag rules).
- **Sibling critic outputs** (if present at the same `N`):
  - `<thread>.{N}.audit/verdict.md` — for the audit flag.
  - `<thread>.{N}.rehearse/timing.md` + `density.md` — for the time and density flags.
- **Optional consumer override**: `.anvil/skills/slides/rubric.overrides.md` (additional critical-flag examples; never reduces the base rubric).
- **Optional `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` flag** (issue #368): when set, the reviewer re-routes its staged_sidecar output from `<thread>.{N}.review/` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>/`, re-targets the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/` (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/`) since the current version's legacy review IS the prior review for a rescore pass, and stamps `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` + `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"` (overwriting any placeholder `rescore_state: "scheduled"` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply`). When the flag is unset, behavior is byte-identical to the default review path. See step 3 for the full re-routing contract.

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.review/
  verdict.md       Top-level decision + total /44 + critical flags (own + propagated) + top revision priorities
  scoring.md       Per-dimension score (0–weight) + 1–3 sentence justification each
  comments.md      Slide-level comments keyed to slide numbers and notes/<NN>-*.md filenames
  _summary.md      9-dim scorecard + top-level rubric block + lint block (pre-flight overflow lint output)
  findings.md      Itemized findings (severity, slide ref, rationale, suggested fix) + "Lint findings" section
                   + "Rubric version transition" subsection (conditional, when prior rubric differs)
  _meta.json       { critic, scorecard_kind: "human-verdict", started, finished, model, schema_version, rubric_id, rubric_total, advance_threshold }
  _progress.json   Phase state for the reviewer (phase: review)
```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the review sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The required files (`verdict.md`, `scoring.md`, `comments.md`, `_summary.md`, `findings.md`, `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`) are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/deck.md`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.review.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed reviewer session (issue #350). If `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete), the review is complete — exit early with a notice (idempotent).
2. **Resume check**: per the staged-sidecar shape introduced in issue #350, a partial review left behind by a mid-cycle interrupt manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` directory; the step 1 sweep has already removed it. Backwards-compat: if a legacy pre-#350 `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists WITHOUT `verdict.md`, delete the dir and re-review.
3. **Open the staged sidecar** for the review dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.review, required_files=["verdict.md", "scoring.md", "comments.md", "_summary.md", "findings.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write from this step through the final `_progress.json` update MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` path. On clean context exit, the primitive verifies the manifest, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name (issue #350). Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json`: `phases.review.state = in_progress`, `phases.review.started = <ISO>`, `for_version: <N>` (per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md`). Also initialize `_meta.json` with `scorecard_kind: human-verdict`, `rubric_id: "anvil-slides-v2"`, `rubric_total: 44`, and `advance_threshold: 35` (see `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` §"The discriminator" — the three rubric-stamping fields are required for new reviews per issue #346; `"anvil-slides-v2"` is the slides skill's current /44 rubric identifier per `anvil/skills/slides/rubric.md` line 3). The rubric-stamping fields let downstream consumers compare scores apples-to-apples across the `/40 → /44` migration without re-reading the skill's current `rubric.md`. Also load the **prior review sibling** at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json` when present and cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or `None` when the prior sibling is absent — first iteration — or lacks the field — legacy pre-#346 review). The cached `prior_rubric_id` feeds the `_summary.md.rubric` block at step 11b + the `findings.md` rubric-transition subsection (step 11d) when the prior rubric differs from the current `"anvil-slides-v2"`.

   **When `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` is set** (issue #368) — the rebackport reviewer-hook contract:
   - **Re-derive `final_dir`** from `<thread>.{N}.review` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>`. The staging directory derived by `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staging_path_for(final_dir)` correspondingly becomes `.<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>.tmp/` — no separate code path is needed; the same `staged_sidecar(final_dir=...)` call works with the rescore sidecar path. The `for_version: <N>` field in `_progress.json` is preserved (it identifies the version being rescored, not the rescore pass itself).
   - **Re-target the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/_meta.json`** (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json`). Under rescore mode, the legacy review at `<thread>.{N}.review/` IS the prior review — the rescore is re-scoring the SAME version's body against an updated rubric, not advancing to a new version. Cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or fall back to `--legacy-rubric` from the rebackport tool when the legacy review lacks the field — pre-#346).
   - **Stamp `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` and `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"`** in addition to the standard rubric-stamping fields. The placeholder `_meta.json` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply` carries `rescore_state: "scheduled"`; this reviewer overwrites it with `"completed"` once the full review (verdict.md / scoring.md / comments.md / _summary.md / findings.md) has landed inside the staging dir. The `rescore_source: "anvil:rubric-rebackport"` field from the placeholder is preserved (or added if absent).
   - **All other behavior is unchanged** — same scoring, same verdict, same `findings.md` emission, same `_summary.md.rubric` block (now carrying the legacy review's rubric as `prior_rubric_id`). The legacy `<thread>.{N}.review/` dir is NEVER mutated — the rescore is a side-car write only.
   - **When `--rescore-mode` is unset**, the steps above DO NOT fire and the review path is byte-identical to the default behavior documented in the rest of this step.
4. **Read inputs**: load `<thread>.{N}/deck.md`, enumerate `notes/*.md` and `figures/`, load `rubric.md` and any consumer override.
4b. **Run pre-flight overflow lint**:
   - Invoke `anvil/lib/marp_lint.py`'s `lint_deck(<thread>.{N}/deck.md)`. This is a Python-stdlib heuristic port of marp-vscode's `slide-content-overflow` diagnostic (see the module docstring for the upstream SHA pin and the per-slide `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: slide-content-overflow -->` escape hatch).
   - The call returns a `LintResult` with `errors: list[Finding]`, `warnings: list[Finding]`, and `infos: list[Finding]`. Each `Finding` has `slide` (1-based slide number), `line` (1-based source line), `rule`, `severity`, and `message`.
   - The lint is **review-phase only** — `slides-draft`, `slides-audit`, `slides-figures`, and `slides-rehearse` do not invoke it. The drafter is intentionally allowed to produce an overflowing slide so the reviser sees the failure mode (issue #31, AC6).
   - Cache the `LintResult` for the `_summary.md` and `findings.md` writes below; cache `lint.errors > 0` as `lint_critical_flag` for the verdict logic.
5. **Read sibling critic outputs** (if present):
   - `<thread>.{N}.audit/verdict.md` — extract any `wrong` claims (these set the audit flag).
   - `<thread>.{N}.rehearse/density.md` — extract any slides exceeding 50 words or 7 bullets (these set the density flag).
   - `<thread>.{N}.rehearse/timing.md` — extract the projected total duration; if >110% of `time_slot_minutes` (from the brief), set the time flag.
6. **Parse the deck**: split `deck.md` on `---` slide separators. For each slide, record: slide number, title, body word count, bullet count, math/diagram presence, figure references. Pair each slide with its `notes/<NN>-*.md` file.
7. **Score each dimension** (1–9 per rubric):
   - Assign an integer between 0 and the dimension's weight.
   - Write a 1–3 sentence justification citing specific evidence (slide number, excerpt, figure reference, notes file).
   - Record per-dimension result in `scoring.md` as a markdown table with columns `# | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification`.
   - **Rhetorical economy (D9)** is the **talk-level** anti-bloat check, distinct from per-slide density (D4). The reviewer asks: could the whole talk land in 30 minutes if the venue offered the option? Are slides 23–28 load-bearing or do they extend a beat that already landed at slide 22? Could the recap slide be cut without losing meaning? D9 is scored from `slides-review`'s source-side judgment only — `slides-vision` does NOT score D9.
8. **Identify own critical flags**: review the deck against the ad-hoc flag examples in `rubric.md` (pedagogical regression, live-demo dependency, unattributed quotation, PII) AND the open-ended "any deal-breaker a sophisticated audience member would catch" instruction. For each flag set, write a one-paragraph justification in `verdict.md`.
9. **Pull in sibling flags**: propagate any audit / density / time flags from sibling critic dirs into the verdict, clearly labeled with their source (e.g., `audit flag — slides-audit verdicted 2 claims wrong`). Do not re-litigate these flags; the auditor and rehearser are authoritative on their respective dimensions.
10. **Compute total**: sum all dimension scores. `advance = (total >= 35) AND (no critical flags from any source)`. The pre-flight lint counts as a critical-flag source: when `lint.errors > 0`, `advance` is forced `false` and the verdict lists `Slide overflow (lint)` under critical flags — the rubric total is reported honestly but does not save the verdict.

   **Append `score_history` row with `rubric_id` (issue #346)**: the orchestrator (the command that drives review→revise iterations) appends one row to `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.metadata.score_history` per finished review iteration. Per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Convergence fields → score_history", the canonical row shape is `{iteration, total, threshold, rubric_id}` — for the slides skill at /44, that's `{iteration: <N>, total: <computed-total>, threshold: 35, rubric_id: "anvil-slides-v2"}`. A thread that spans the `/40 → /44` migration records different `rubric_id` values across its rows; readers tolerate rows missing `rubric_id` per the backwards-compat contract (treat as `"unknown/legacy"`). See `convergence.check_stable` for the precedent on `None`-tolerance.
11. **Write slide-level comments**: in `comments.md`, list specific feedback keyed to slide numbers (e.g., `### Slide 7: Architecture overview`) — heading reference + short excerpt + comment. Group by severity (`blocker` / `major` / `minor` / `nit`). Reference notes files where note quality is the issue (e.g., `notes/14-results.md is empty`).
11b. **Write `_summary.md`** as a JSON-in-markdown scorecard with a top-level `rubric` block (issue #346) sibling to `lint`. The `lint` block is populated from the cached `LintResult` returned by step 4b; the `rubric` block carries the rubric the reviewer scored against so a downstream consumer aggregating across versions does not need to walk back to `anvil/skills/slides/rubric.md` (which may have changed between v3 and v5 of a long thread that spanned the `/40 → /44` migration):
    ```markdown
    # Review summary

    ```json
    {
      "critic": "review",
      "for_version": <N>,
      "rubric": {
        "id": "anvil-slides-v2",
        "total": 44,
        "advance_threshold": 35,
        "dimensions": 9,
        "prior_rubric_id": "anvil-slides-v1"
      },
      "dimensions": { /* 9-dim scorecard per rubric.md */ },
      "lint": {
        "ran": true,
        "errors": 1,
        "warnings": 0,
        "errors_by_slide": [
          { "slide": 7, "line": 51, "rule": "slide-content-overflow", "severity": "error", "message": "Slide exceeds estimated vertical capacity..." }
        ],
        "warnings_by_slide": []
      },
      "critical_flag": true,
      "critical_flag_notes": [
        { "type": "slide_overflow_lint", "slide_refs": ["Slide 7"], "justification": "Pre-flight overflow lint flagged 1 slide as exceeding estimated vertical capacity." }
      ]
    }
    ```
    ```

    The `rubric` block fields:
    - `id` (`str`): the rubric identifier — `"anvil-slides-v2"` for the current /44 rubric. Mirrors `_meta.json.rubric_id`.
    - `total` (`int`): the rubric's declared `total` — `44`.
    - `advance_threshold` (`int`): the rubric's declared advance threshold — `35`.
    - `dimensions` (`int`): the count of weighted dimensions — `9`.
    - `prior_rubric_id` (`str | null`, conditional): present when the prior review sibling at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` exists. Value is the prior `_meta.json.rubric_id` when present, or `null` when the prior sibling lacks the field (legacy pre-#346 review). **Omitted entirely** on the first iteration (no prior review sibling exists).
    - `prior_rubric_inferred` (`str`, conditional): present when `prior_rubric_id == null` AND a prior review sibling exists. Value is `"/40-legacy"`.

    When `lint.errors > 0`, set `critical_flag: true` and append a `{ "type": "slide_overflow_lint", ... }` entry to `critical_flag_notes` — the lint is treated as a critical-flag source on par with the audit / density / time flags.
11c. **Write `findings.md`** with both review findings and a "Lint findings" subsection. The "Lint findings" section is present even if empty (write `_No lint findings._`):
    ```
    ## Findings

    1. **[major]** Slide 7: Architecture diagram unlabeled. Suggested fix: add boxed labels for each block before submission.
    ...

    ## Lint findings

    1. **[error]** Slide 7 (line 51): Slide exceeds estimated vertical capacity by ~2.0 line-units. Top costs: image=7.0u, h2=2.0u. Suggested fix: replace the trailing 4 bullets with a single italic supporting line under the figure.
    ```
11d. **Emit rubric-version-transition subsection in `findings.md` when the prior rubric differs (issue #346)**: when the cached `prior_rubric_id` from step 3 is non-`None` AND differs from the current `"anvil-slides-v2"`, OR when `prior_rubric_id == None` AND a prior review sibling exists (legacy pre-#346 review), append a `## Rubric version transition` subsection to `findings.md` (sibling to the existing `## Findings` and `## Lint findings` subsections). The subsection's purpose is **operator visibility** — it surfaces, in plain prose, the fact that this iteration's score is NOT directly comparable to the prior iteration's score. Three shapes:

    When the prior rubric is a different stamped id:
    ```
    ## Rubric version transition

    This iteration was scored against `anvil-slides-v2` (/44, ≥35); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` was scored against `anvil-slides-v1` (/40, ≥32). The score delta `<prior_total>/40 → <current_total>/44` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/44` against the `≥35/44` threshold.
    ```

    When the prior rubric is legacy (no `rubric_id` stamped):
    ```
    ## Rubric version transition

    This iteration was scored against `anvil-slides-v2` (/44, ≥35); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` predates per-review rubric version stamping (issue #346) and was scored against `/40-legacy` — the rubric this skill shipped before the `/40 → /44` migration (likely `anvil-slides-v1`, /40, ≥32). The score delta `<prior_total>/40-legacy → <current_total>/44` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/44` against the `≥35/44` threshold.
    ```

    When the prior rubric matches the current rubric (the steady-state case — no transition surfaced):
    ```
    (subsection omitted entirely)
    ```

    The subsection is **observational** — it does NOT affect the verdict, the critical-flag list, or the `advance` decision. Backwards-compat: a legacy review sibling produced before this contract shipped does NOT need to be re-emitted.
12. **Write `verdict.md`** in the format specified in `rubric.md`:
    - Total: `XX / 44`
    - Decision: `advance: true` or `advance: false`
    - Critical flags (if any), labeled by source. When `lint.errors > 0`, include `Slide overflow (lint)` as one of the labeled flag entries.
    - Dimension summary table (per-dim scores; full justifications in `scoring.md`)
    - Top 3 revision priorities (if `advance: false`)
13. **Update `_progress.json`** inside the staging dir: `phases.review.state = done`, `phases.review.completed = <ISO>`. This is the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires `_progress.json` to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies every name in the required-files manifest exists in the staging dir, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.review/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.
14. **Report**: print the path to the (now-renamed) review dir and a one-line status (e.g., `Reviewed kdd-2026-keynote.1 → kdd-2026-keynote.1.review/ (32/44, advance: false, 1 audit flag, 2 density flags)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

- A completed review (`review.state == done` AND `verdict.md` exists with a parseable score) is never re-run. Re-invoking is a no-op with a notice.
- A crashed review is re-runnable after deleting partial output.
- Validation is by file existence (does `verdict.md` exist and parse?), not solely by flag.

## Re-running on revision

When a new `<thread>.{N+1}/` is produced by `slides-revise`, the orchestrator runs all three critics (`slides-review`, `slides-audit`, `slides-rehearse`) against the new version. The reviewer for `<thread>.{N+1}/` is a fresh invocation writing to `<thread>.{N+1}.review/`; it does NOT consult the prior version's review (the changelog in `<thread>.{N+1}/changelog.md` is the audit trail for what was addressed).

## Notes for the reviewer agent

- **Be honest, not encouraging.** The skill is not "polish the deck." It is "would this talk hold up in front of the declared audience for the declared time slot?" Score accordingly.
- **Trust the auditor and rehearser.** Pull their flags in verbatim; do not re-score the dimensions they own. The reviewer scores all 8 dimensions, but the audit/density/time flags themselves are upstream — propagate them.
- **Pedagogy beats polish.** A clear plain slide beats a beautiful confusing one. Score Dimension 2 before Dimension 5.
- **Notes matter for talks.** Every slide needs a notes file with substantive content; perfunctory or empty notes are a Dimension 7 failure.
- **Comments should be actionable.** "Tighten this slide" is not useful. "Slide 7 has 8 bullets — split into two slides at the architecture / data-flow boundary" is useful.
