  "story": "Fires spread very slowly (β=0.1) over long games (20 nights minimum), but high work cost (c=0.8) punishes constant vigilance. The optimal strategy requires identifying when heroic action is needed versus when rest is acceptable. A few well-timed interventions beat continuous effort.",

    "Can agents learn when to rest versus when to work?",
