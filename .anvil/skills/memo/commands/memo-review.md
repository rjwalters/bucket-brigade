# memo-review — Reviewer

**Role**: reviewer.
**Reads**: latest `<thread>.{N}/` (specifically `<thread>.md` and any `exhibits/`).
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.review/` with `verdict.md`, `scoring.md`, `comments.md`, and `_progress.json`.

The review sibling directory is **read-only once written**. Revisions consume it; they never modify it.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: enumerated from disk as the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md` existing.
- **Rubric**: `anvil/skills/memo/rubric.md` (9 dimensions, /44, ≥35 threshold, critical flags).
- **Optional consumer override**: `.anvil/skills/memo/rubric.overrides.md` (additional critical-flag examples; never reduces the base rubric).
- **Optional per-doc rubric overrides** (issue #233 / #265, consolidated under #296): the `rubric_overrides:` block on the matching `documents:` entry in `<project>/BRIEF.md`, parsed via `anvil/skills/memo/lib/project_brief.py::load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`. When present, per-dimension `dim_N_calibration` strings are appended as verbatim suffixes to each affected dimension's `scoring.md` justification (see step 4h + the §"Rubric overrides (rubric_overrides) — calibration suffixes" subsection below).
- **Optional `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` flag** (issue #368): when set, the reviewer re-routes its staged_sidecar output from `<thread>.{N}.review/` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>/`, re-targets the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/` (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/`) since the current version's legacy review IS the prior review for a rescore pass, and stamps `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` + `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"` (overwriting any placeholder `rescore_state: "scheduled"` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply`). When the flag is unset, behavior is byte-identical to the default review path. See step 3 for the full re-routing contract.

## Reader dispatch order: structured `rubric_overrides` vs unstructured BRIEF.md prose

A thread MAY surface non-investment-memo calibration guidance in two places:

1. **Structured config** on the matching `documents:` entry of `<project>/BRIEF.md`, under the `rubric_overrides:` block (the primary, machine-readable path shipped under issue #233, consolidated under issue #296). The reader is `anvil/skills/memo/lib/project_brief.py::load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`; per-dimension calibrations attach as verbatim suffixes to `scoring.md` justifications per step 4h.
2. **Author-side prose** in `BRIEF.md`'s free body (the legacy convention surfaced by the Studio canary's 2 READY-at-39/40 threads, the workaround that motivated #233 in the first place). The "Critical reviewer guidance" section is freeform prose telling the reviewer how to interpret specific dimensions for the non-standard shape.

**Precedence — structured config wins.** When BOTH sources are present, the reviewer reads the structured `rubric_overrides:` block first and applies per-dimension calibrations to `scoring.md` justifications via the suffix mechanism. The `BRIEF.md` "Critical reviewer guidance" prose section is then treated as **documented fallback / context** — the reviewer reads it for additional context (especially for `memo_subtype`-level orientation that does not map cleanly to a per-dim calibration) but does NOT re-apply its prose as a suffix (that would double-count the calibration in the audit trail). When ONLY the BRIEF prose carries the guidance (no `rubric_overrides:` block on the matching `documents:` entry, or no matching entry, or no project BRIEF at all), the reviewer reads the BRIEF.md guidance and respects it inline in its `scoring.md` justifications — the pre-#233 status quo for the two canary threads. When ONLY the structured config carries the guidance (the recommended steady-state for new threads going forward), the suffix mechanism is the entire calibration surface.

**Why structured-config-wins.** The structured `rubric_overrides:` shape is the schema-of-record contract — it is parseable, validated by the typed loader, surfaces malformed inputs cleanly, and produces a deterministic audit trail (`scoring.md` carries the verbatim suffix). The `BRIEF.md` free-prose guidance is author-discretion and can phrase the same intent in 20 different ways; making it the secondary source decouples the reviewer's mechanical behavior from author wording. Consumers migrating off the legacy prose convention should move their guidance into the per-doc `rubric_overrides:` block over the next 2-3 revisions; the prose fallback ships indefinitely as backwards-compat.

```

**Atomicity** (issue #350): the review sibling dir is written **atomically** via the staged-sidecar primitive at `anvil/lib/sidecar.py`. The six files are staged under a leading-dot sibling `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` during writing; on clean completion the staging dir is renamed (one atomic `Path.rename`) to the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` name. A mid-cycle interrupt leaves a `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` dir on disk that the next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep removes; the final-named dir never exists in partial form. Discovery (`anvil/lib/critics.py::discover_critics`) is unchanged — the leading-dot staging shape is invisible to the discovery glob.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state**: find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md`. Then **sweep stale staging dirs from prior interrupts** by invoking `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::cleanup_stale_staging(<portfolio_root>)` where `<portfolio_root>` is the directory that contains `<thread>.{N}/`. This removes any leftover `.<thread>.<M>.review.tmp/` (and other `.<...>.tmp/`) shapes left behind by a previously-killed reviewer/auditor/reviser session (issue #350). The sweep is idempotent and logs at INFO level the count + names of removed dirs. If `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists AND `verdict.md` is present (the atomic-rename contract guarantees the dir only exists when complete — see `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Crash recovery contract" §"Critic sidecar dir — atomic rename"), the review is complete — exit early with a notice (idempotent).
2. **Resume contract**: per the staged-sidecar shape introduced in issue #350, a partial review left behind by a mid-cycle interrupt manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` directory (NOT as a partially-filled `<thread>.{N}.review/`). The sweep in step 1 has already removed any such partial; no per-file resume scan is required, and the legacy "verdict.md missing → delete and re-review" partial-output check is obsolete (the rename-as-marker contract means a non-existent `<thread>.{N}.review/` cleanly means "no review has run", and an existing `<thread>.{N}.review/` cleanly means "review is complete"). If, for compatibility with pre-#350 sidecars produced before this contract shipped, a legacy `<thread>.{N}.review/` exists WITHOUT `verdict.md`, delete the dir and re-review — the backwards-compat fallback path.
3. **Open the staged sidecar** for the review dir by invoking the context manager `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staged_sidecar(final_dir=<thread>.{N}.review, required_files=["verdict.md", "scoring.md", "comments.md", "_summary.md", "_meta.json", "_progress.json"])`. Every file write from this step through step 11 MUST land **inside the yielded staging directory** (the path the context manager yields, of the shape `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/`), NOT inside the final `<thread>.{N}.review/` path. On clean context exit, the staged sidecar primitive verifies every name in the manifest exists, then atomically renames the staging dir to its final name. The final dir only ever exists in complete form; discovery checks "dir exists" and that remains sufficient (see `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Crash recovery contract"). On exception or missing required file at exit, the staging dir is left in place for next-startup `cleanup_stale_staging` GC — DO NOT attempt to manually clean it up here. Then, **inside the staging dir**, initialize `_progress.json`: `phases.review.state = in_progress`, `phases.review.started = <ISO>` (per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md`). Also initialize `_meta.json` with `scorecard_kind: human-verdict`, `rubric_id: "anvil-memo-v2"`, `rubric_total: 44`, and `advance_threshold: 35` (see `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` §"The discriminator" — the three rubric-stamping fields are required for new reviews per issue #346; `"anvil-memo-v2"` is the memo skill's current /44 rubric identifier per `anvil/skills/memo/rubric.md` line 3). The rubric-stamping fields let downstream consumers compare scores apples-to-apples across the `/40 → /44` migration without re-reading the skill's current `rubric.md`. Also load the **prior review sibling** at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json` when present and cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or `None` when the prior sibling is absent — first iteration — or lacks the field — legacy pre-#346 review). The cached `prior_rubric_id` feeds the `_summary.md.rubric` block at step 9 + the `findings.md` rubric-transition subsection when the prior rubric differs from the current `"anvil-memo-v2"`.

   **When `--rescore-mode <rescore-id>` is set** (issue #368) — the rebackport reviewer-hook contract:
   - **Re-derive `final_dir`** from `<thread>.{N}.review` to `<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>`. The staging directory derived by `anvil/lib/sidecar.py::staging_path_for(final_dir)` correspondingly becomes `.<thread>.{N}.review.rescore-<rescore-id>.tmp/` — no separate code path is needed; the same `staged_sidecar(final_dir=...)` call works with the rescore sidecar path.
   - **Re-target the prior-review lookup to `<thread>.{N}.review/_meta.json`** (NOT `<thread>.{N-1}.review/_meta.json`). Under rescore mode, the legacy review at `<thread>.{N}.review/` IS the prior review — the rescore is re-scoring the SAME version's body against an updated rubric, not advancing to a new version. Cache its `rubric_id` value as `prior_rubric_id` (or fall back to `--legacy-rubric` from the rebackport tool when the legacy review lacks the field — pre-#346).
   - **Stamp `_meta.json` with `rescore_state: "completed"` and `rescore_id: "<rescore-id>"`** in addition to the standard rubric-stamping fields. The placeholder `_meta.json` left behind by `anvil:rubric-rebackport --rescore --apply` carries `rescore_state: "scheduled"`; this reviewer overwrites it with `"completed"` once the full review (verdict.md / scoring.md / comments.md / _summary.md) has landed inside the staging dir. The `rescore_source: "anvil:rubric-rebackport"` field from the placeholder is preserved (or added if absent).
   - **All other behavior is unchanged** — same scoring, same verdict, same `findings.md` emission, same `_summary.md.rubric` block (now carrying the legacy review's rubric as `prior_rubric_id`). The legacy `<thread>.{N}.review/` dir is NEVER mutated — the rescore is a side-car write only.
   - **When `--rescore-mode` is unset**, the steps above DO NOT fire and the review path is byte-identical to the default behavior documented in the rest of this step.
4. **Read inputs**: load `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md`, enumerate `exhibits/`, load `rubric.md` and any consumer override. Resolve the declared `target_length` for v{N} by reading it from `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.metadata.target_length_resolved` (the field the drafter or reviser wrote when producing v{N}). The field carries the resolved `(min_words, max_words)` pair plus a `source` provenance string (`"overrides.<N>"`, `"default"`, or `"none"`). Reading this field — rather than re-resolving from `<project>/BRIEF.md` here — is the load-bearing behavior: it pins the reviewer's dim 7 anchor to the same range the drafter/reviser authored against and prevents drift if BRIEF.md is edited between draft and review.

   If `target_length_resolved` is absent (legacy v{N} from before this field shipped, or a hand-built version dir), fall back to re-resolving from `<project>/BRIEF.md`'s matching `documents:` entry: `target_length_overrides["<N>"]` → `target_length` → no target. Normalize: `words` taken directly, `pages` converted at 600 words/page, malformed/absent → no target (dim 7 falls back to the implicit "reasonable" judgment).
4b. **Run pre-flight image-reference lint (source-side)** — issue #146:
   - Invoke `anvil/skills/memo/lib/memo_image_refs.py`'s `lint_memo_image_refs(<thread>.{N}/)`. This is a Python-stdlib heuristic check (no third-party deps, no Marp / Pandoc invocation) that parses `<thread>.md` for both markdown `![alt](path)` syntax AND HTML `<img src="...">` syntax. For each ref it resolves the path relative to the version directory and verifies the file exists. URL refs (`http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, `data:`, `ftp://`, `file://`) and absolute filesystem paths (`/abs/...`) are skipped — out of scope per the v0 contract.
   - The call returns a `LintResult` with `errors: list[Finding]`, `warnings: list[Finding]`, and `infos: list[Finding]`. Each `Finding` has `line` (1-based source line), `rule` (always `"memo_image_refs_exist"` for this lint), `severity`, `message`, `ref` (the raw reference string), and `resolved_path` (the absolute path the ref resolved to).
   - When a missing ref names a subdirectory (e.g., `exhibits/foo.png`) AND a file with the same basename exists at the version-dir root (e.g., `<version_dir>/foo.png`), the diagnostic surfaces the **`cp -r` footgun shape** explicitly — the canary failure mode documented in #146 (`cp -r .../old/exhibits .../new/` expanded to dump files into the version root because the destination did not exist as a directory).
   - **Escape hatch**: `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_image_refs_exist -->` placed on the same line as a ref, or on the immediately preceding line, downgrades that finding from `error` to `info` so the lint records that the ref is intentionally absent (e.g., `memo-figures` will generate it later) without blocking advance.
   - The lint is **review-phase only** — the drafter and reviser do not invoke it. The drafter is intentionally allowed to produce a stale-path memo so the reviser sees the failure mode (precedent: deck-review step 5b, per the curator addendum on issue #31 / AC6).
   - Cache the `LintResult` for the `_summary.md` write below; cache `lint.errors > 0` as `lint_critical_flag` for the verdict logic at step 7.
4c. **Read render-gate findings (non-blocking, graceful-degrade)** — Epic #158 Phase 4 / issue #196:
   - Read `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.render_gate` (the top-level block written by `memo-render` per `commands/memo-render.md` step 6 + the `GateResult.to_json()` shape from `anvil/lib/render_gate.py`). The block carries `{gate, pdf_path, log_path, pages, page_cap, overfull_boxes, compile, placeholders, findings, pass, reasons}`. Each entry in `findings` is `{gate, severity, message, location}` where `gate` is one of `memo_compile_success` / `memo_page_fit` / `memo_overfull_check` / `memo_image_refs_exist` / `memo_placeholder_scan`.
   - **Graceful-degrade when absent**: if `_progress.json` is missing entirely, or `_progress.json.render_gate` is missing (the memo was never rendered — legal pre-Phase-3 state, every memo version drafted before Epic #158 has this shape, AND the current state when `memo-render` is unavailable on PATH or the consumer has not installed Anvil's Phase 3 commands), record a single info-level note in the cached `render_gate_block` (`{"ran": false, "reason": "no render_gate block in _progress.json"}`) and skip silently. The reviewer's dim 7 judgment falls back to word-count-only per `rubric.md` §"Length targets" — same behavior as before this phase shipped. This is the load-bearing backwards-compat contract.
   - **Non-blocking**: render-gate findings DO NOT abort the review, DO NOT set the verdict's `lint_critical_flag`, and DO NOT force `advance: false`. They are surfaced in `_summary.md.render_gate` for the operator to see and for the dim 7 justification to reference, but the verdict at step 7 is driven by the rubric total + the four critical-flag categories + the source-side `memo_image_refs_exist` lint (step 4b). Per `rubric.md` §"Length targets" §"Word count is primary; rendered page count is second-layer advisory": word count remains the primary measure; the rendered page count is a second-layer advisory the reviewer reads alongside it.
   - **Severity model surfaced verbatim**: the render gate classifies `memo_page_fit` findings as `error` when the operator declared `target_length.pages` (an explicit page-range contract) and `warning` when they declared `target_length.words` (the page-range is derived via the 600-words-per-page proxy; dim 7 word-count is authoritative). The reviewer does NOT re-derive the severity; the gate's classification is the contract. The `_summary.md.render_gate.findings_by_dimension` block surfaces the severities verbatim from `render_gate.findings`.
   - **Mirror of the deck-side shape**: this step mirrors the deck-side `_summary.md.lint` block that `deck-review` already produces (see `commands/deck-review.md` step 5b + step 9 — pre-flight `marp_lint` findings surfaced in `_summary.md.lint.errors_by_slide` + `lint.warnings_by_slide`). The memo block is named `render_gate` (not `lint`) so it stays distinct from the existing memo-side `lint` block (`memo_image_refs` + `refs_pdf_extraction`) that step 4b owns.
   - Cache the parsed block as `render_gate_block` for the `_summary.md` write at step 9. The dim 7 scoring at step 5 SHOULD read `render_gate_block.pages` (when present and non-null) for the rendered-page-count second-layer signal documented in `rubric.md` §"Length targets" §"Word count is primary; rendered page count is second-layer advisory".
4d. **Run memo↔deck parity lint (Phase A, warning-only)** — issue #215 (memo-side mirror of deck-review step 5d / PR #205 / issue #200):
   - Invoke `anvil/skills/memo/lib/parity_lint.py`'s `lint_memo_deck_parity(<thread>.{N}/, <sibling deck version dir or None>)`. This is a Python-stdlib heuristic check (no third-party deps, no Marp / Pandoc invocation) that extracts hard-claim tokens — money (`$XXK/M/B`, decimal prices), percentages (including en-dash ranges), quarters/FY tags, named months + year, ALL-CAPS acronyms (length 2-6), and unit-bearing integers — from both `<thread>.md` and the sibling `deck.md` body, then compares the two token sets and flags any token present in one body but absent from the other. The module is a **near-byte-identical mirror** of `anvil/skills/deck/lib/parity_lint.py` (PR #205) with the "primary artifact" framing flipped — `lint_source(memo_source, deck_source)` takes memo first, the rule label is `memo_deck_parity`, the escape-hatch directive is `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_deck_parity -->`, and `LintResult.deck_sibling` mirrors the deck-side `memo_sibling`. The `Finding.side` values (`"only_in_memo"` / `"only_in_deck"`) are preserved verbatim — they describe *which body the token came from*, independent of which side is "primary".
   - **Sibling-deck-version discovery is the caller's (this command's) responsibility in v0**. Convention: at the portfolio root that contains `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md`, look for sibling deck version dirs matching `<thread>.{M}/deck.md` and pick the highest `M`. If no sibling deck version exists (single-pipeline thread — most non-Studio consumers, and Studio threads where only the memo has shipped), pass `deck_version_dir=None`. Mirrors the deck-side's portfolio-root convention exactly. Centralizing the discovery in `anvil/lib/parity.py` is part of the now-fired second-consumer promotion plan — see the WORK_LOG entry for #215.
   - **Graceful-skip when no deck sibling**: `lint_memo_deck_parity(memo_dir, None)` (or with a sibling dir that lacks `deck.md`) returns `LintResult(skipped=True, reason="no deck sibling found at portfolio root; parity check inactive", deck_sibling=None)` with zero findings. `memo-review` proceeds normally — the rest of the review/verdict logic is byte-identical to a thread without the parity lint enabled. The skip is RECORDED in `_summary.md.lint.memo_deck_parity` (`ran: false`, `deck_sibling: null`, `reason: "..."`) and as a single info-level entry in `findings.md` § Parity-lint findings, so the operator sees WHY the check did not fire — same skip-reason convention as `lint.refs_pdf_extraction` (step 5) and the deck-side's `lint.deck_memo_parity` (deck-review step 5d).
   - The call returns a `LintResult` with `warnings: list[Finding]`, `infos: list[Finding]`, `skipped: bool`, `reason: str | None`, and `deck_sibling: str | None`. Each `Finding` has `line` (1-based source line in whichever body the token appeared), `rule="memo_deck_parity"`, `severity="warning"` (or `"info"` if suppressed), `message` (a human-readable diagnostic naming the canary anchor), `token` (the normalized token surface form), and `side` (`"only_in_memo"` or `"only_in_deck"`).
   - **v0 ships at `warning` severity only** (Phase A). Parity findings do NOT contribute to `lint_critical_flag` and do NOT force `advance: false` — the `errors` list on the result is always empty in v0. Verdict aggregation (step 7) is byte-identical to a thread without this lint enabled. Phase B promotion to `error` severity (and therefore `advance: false`-gating) is a separate decision deferred 2–4 weeks after Phase A merge, based on canary consumption signal. This Phase A / Phase B ship-with-falsifiability pattern (single named consumer + bounded observation window + explicit kill-switch criterion) is the same shape used by the kill-switch precedent recorded in `WORK_LOG.md` 2026-06-02 (issue #227) and is carried verbatim from the deck-side step 5d.
   - **Escape hatch**: `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_deck_parity -->` placed on the same line as a deliberately-memo-only or deliberately-deck-only claim (or on the line directly above) downgrades that finding from `warning` to `info`. Use case: the deck says "we considered FTC enforcement" but the memo deliberately omits it for prose density — the operator marks the claim and the lint stops complaining. Comma-separated rule lists (`<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_deck_parity, memo_image_refs_exist -->`) are honored.
   - **Canary anchor**: the load-bearing failure mode this lint catches (from the memo-side POV) is the symmetric direction of Citation Clear memo.4 ↔ deck.3 — a deck pulling ahead of the memo on a load-bearing hard claim (e.g., the reviser tightens an insurer benchmark to "~50–60% completion" in deck.4 that memo.4 lacked) that no anvil primitive would otherwise detect. The deck-side step 5d catches the inverse drift direction (memo.4 introducing a claim deck.3 lacked); together the two checks cover both directions and are symmetric / idempotent — running deck-review and memo-review on the same `<thread>.{N}` produces the same warning set with the same tokens, just with rule names `deck_memo_parity` vs `memo_deck_parity`.
   - Cache the `LintResult` for the `_summary.md` write at step 9 and the `findings.md` write at step 10 (advisory only — `verdict.md` MAY reference under "Top revision priorities" but is NOT required). **Do NOT OR this lint's findings into `lint_critical_flag`** — Phase A is observational only.
4e. **Run summary-detail consistency back-check (Phase A, reviewer-judgment)** — issue #245:
   - This is a **reviewer-prose-only** sub-step in Phase A — no Python module is invoked. Following the §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" precedent (`commands/memo-review.md` step 5, fully reviewer-judgment with no automated `refs/` parsing in v0), the reviewer enumerates load-bearing summary claims, locates their detail elaboration, classifies any mismatch by verdict tag + severity, and emits a structured `summary_detail_consistency` block + a `findings.md` subsection. An automated detector at `anvil/skills/memo/lib/summary_detail.py` is a Phase B follow-on, gated on canary signal.
   - **Procedure (three phases)** — mirrors the issue body's "Proposed shape" list and `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency":
     1. **Enumerate summary claims** — scan the callout block(s), abstract / TL;DR block, thesis block (first 1-3 paragraphs depending on memo shape), and any "what we believe" frontmatter for load-bearing assertions per `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" §"What counts as a load-bearing summary claim". Count each as a numbered claim (claim 1, claim 2, …). Record the source `summary_location` for each claim (e.g., `"callout bullet 1 (page 1)"`, `"§1 thesis paragraph 1"`). If the memo has no callout / abstract / thesis block to scan (short memos), record `ran: false` with `reason: "no callout / abstract / thesis block identified in <thread>.md"` and skip the rest of this step — the reviewer is required to explicitly emit `ran: false` rather than omit the block (same convention as `lint.refs_pdf_extraction` and `lint.memo_deck_parity`).
     2. **Locate the detailed elaboration** — for each summary claim, find the section(s) where it is elaborated. Use explicit `§N` references when present in the claim itself; fall back to topic / load-bearing-noun-phrase matching when absent. Record the `detail_location` (e.g., `"§2.2 (Pericles.2)"`) or `"(absent)"` when no detail section elaborates the claim.
     3. **Classify the mismatch** — for each (summary claim, detail section) pair, apply the verdict tag and severity from `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" §"Verdict tags" + §"Severity ladder":
        - **`MATCH`** — no finding emitted.
        - **`ABSENT`** — severity `important` typically; `critical` when the claim is the memo's thesis or a load-bearing recommendation justification.
        - **`CONTRADICTED`** — severity **always `critical`** (the canary failure mode).
        - **`DIVERGENT`** — severity `suggestion` typically; `important` when the framing change shifts the recommendation.
   - **Cache the structured block** for the `_summary.md` write at step 9 and the `findings.md` write at step 10. Specifically, cache `summary_detail_block` as:
     - `ran: bool` — `true` when summary blocks were identified and scanned; `false` (with `reason` populated) when no summary block was found.
     - `summary_blocks_scanned: list[str]` — descriptive labels for each scanned block (e.g., `["callout (page 1)", "§1 thesis paragraph 1"]`).
     - `claims_enumerated: int` — total count of load-bearing summary claims identified.
     - `findings_count: int` — total count of non-`MATCH` findings.
     - `findings_by_severity: {critical, important, suggestion}` — count of findings per severity bucket.
     - `findings: list[dict]` — one entry per non-`MATCH` finding with `claim_id`, `claim_excerpt`, `summary_location`, `detail_location`, `verdict`, `severity`, `message`, `suggested_fix`, and (when `severity == "critical"`) `load_bearing_justification`. Full shape and field semantics: see step 9 below.
     - `critical_flag_candidate: bool` — convenience flag for step 7 verdict aggregation. MUST equal `any(f.severity == "critical" and f.verdict == "CONTRADICTED" for f in findings)`. Implementer convention; not duplicated state.
   - **Cache `summary_detail_critical_flag = summary_detail_block.critical_flag_candidate`** for the verdict logic at step 7. A `CONTRADICTED` finding at `critical` severity surfaces as a `Summary-detail consistency: CONTRADICTED` critical flag in `verdict.md` (see step 10) and forces `advance: false` via the existing critical-flag pathway. `ABSENT` and `DIVERGENT` findings at `important` / `suggestion` severity are observational only and do NOT force `advance: false`.
   - **Related (back-check triangle)**: this is the *intra-memo* back-check (memo A summary ↔ memo A detail). The §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" sub-step at step 5 below covers memo A claim ↔ memo A `refs/`. The #236 cross-thread analog (step 4f below) covers memo A claim ↔ memo B `§N`. Together the three legs cover the back-check triangle. See `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" §"Related" for the composition contract.
4f. **Run cross-thread citation back-check (Phase A, reviewer-judgment)** — issue #236:
   - This is a **reviewer-prose-only** sub-step in Phase A — no Python module is invoked. Following the §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" precedent (`commands/memo-review.md` step 5, fully reviewer-judgment with no automated `refs/` parsing in v0) and the §"Summary-detail consistency" precedent (step 4e above, issue #245 / PR #250), the reviewer enumerates cross-thread citations in `<thread>.md`, resolves each to `(thread_slug, latest_version_dir, section_anchor)`, classifies any mismatch by verdict tag + severity, and emits a structured `cross_thread_cite_consistency` block + a `findings.md` subsection. An automated detector at `anvil/skills/memo/lib/cross_thread_cite.py` (skill-local first per CLAUDE.md §"Skill-local first, lib promotion later") is a Phase B follow-on, gated on canary signal.
   - **Procedure (three phases)** — mirrors the issue body's "Cite patterns to detect" + "Proposed shapes" lists and `rubric.md` §"Cross-thread citation back-check (dim 3)":
     1. **Enumerate cross-thread cites** — scan `<thread>.md` for citation-shaped patterns referencing other anvil threads per `rubric.md` §"Cross-thread citation back-check (dim 3)" §"What counts as a cross-thread citation". Catch all four shapes permissively:
        - **Literal-path**: `<thread-slug>/memo.<N>/<thread>.md` (e.g., `brasidas-synthesis/memo.2/<thread>.md`).
        - **Short-form**: `<thread-slug> §X` or `<thread-slug>/memo §X` (e.g., `brasidas-synthesis §3.1`).
        - **Relative-path** (studio convention): `output/<thread-slug>/...` (e.g., `output/brasidas-synthesis/memo.2/<thread>.md`).
        - **Backtick-wrapped**: `` `<thread-slug>/memo.<N>/<thread>.md` §<X> `` (e.g., `` `brasidas-synthesis/memo.2/<thread>.md` §5.2 ``).
        Count each as a numbered cite (cite 1, cite 2, …). Record the source `summary_location` for each cite (e.g., `"§2 paragraph 3 (<thread>.md line 47)"`). If `<thread>.md` contains no cross-thread cites, record `ran: false` with `reason: "no cross-thread citations identified in <thread>.md"` and skip the rest of this step — the reviewer is required to explicitly emit `ran: false` rather than omit the block (same convention as `lint.refs_pdf_extraction`, `lint.memo_deck_parity`, and `summary_detail_consistency` at step 4e).
     2. **Resolve each cite** — for each enumerated cite, resolve to `(thread_slug, latest_version_dir, section_anchor)`:
        - The **cited thread** resolves to the latest `<thread-slug>.{N}/` directory under the portfolio root (highest `N`) — cross-thread cites point at a **moving target** by default. **Pinning to a specific cited version** (e.g., `brasidas-synthesis.2`) is a **stronger contract** the reviewer notes positively in the dim 3 justification (NOT a deduction).
        - The **section anchor** is the `§N` or section-header reference in the cite text. Scan the cited `<thread>.md` for a matching header.
        - Record the `resolved_path` (e.g., `"<portfolio_root>/brasidas-synthesis.2/<thread>.md"`) and `section_anchor` (e.g., `"§3.1"`) for each cite.
     3. **Classify by verdict tag** — for each (cite, resolved location) tuple, apply the verdict tag and severity from `rubric.md` §"Cross-thread citation back-check (dim 3)" §"Verdict tags" + §"Severity ladder":
        - **`ANCHOR-FOUND`** — no finding emitted (silent). Cited thread + version + anchor all resolved cleanly.
        - **`ANCHOR-MISSING-BUT-THREAD-PRESENT`** — severity `important`; **-1 dim 3 deduction**. Cited thread exists but §N anchor not found in latest version. The canary failure mode.
        - **`ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED`** — severity **always `critical`**; **-2 dim 3 deduction AND critical-flag candidate**. §N exists at the cited location but its content materially contradicts the claim the citing memo attributes to it.
        - **`THREAD-NOT-FOUND`** — severity `important`; **-1 dim 3 deduction**. Cited thread slug does not resolve to any directory under the portfolio root.
   - **Cache the structured block** for the `_summary.md` write at step 9 and the `findings.md` write at step 10. Specifically, cache `cross_thread_cite_block` as:
     - `ran: bool` — `true` when at least one cross-thread cite was identified and resolved; `false` (with `reason` populated) when no cross-thread cites were found.
     - `cites_enumerated: int` — total count of cross-thread cites identified.
     - `findings_count: int` — total count of non-`ANCHOR-FOUND` findings.
     - `findings: list[dict]` — one entry per non-`ANCHOR-FOUND` finding with `cite_text`, `summary_location`, `resolved_path`, `section_anchor`, `verdict`, `severity`, `justification`. Full shape and field semantics: see step 9 below.
     - `critical_flag_candidate: bool` — convenience flag for step 7 verdict aggregation. MUST equal `any(f.severity == "critical" and f.verdict == "ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED" for f in findings)`. Implementer convention; not duplicated state.
   - **Cache `cross_thread_cite_critical_flag = cross_thread_cite_block.critical_flag_candidate`** for the verdict logic at step 7. An `ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` finding at `critical` severity surfaces as a `Cross-thread cite: ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` critical flag in `verdict.md` (see step 10) and forces `advance: false` via the existing critical-flag pathway. `ANCHOR-MISSING-BUT-THREAD-PRESENT` and `THREAD-NOT-FOUND` findings at `important` severity are observational only and do NOT force `advance: false` (the per-instance dim 3 deduction is the natural surface).
   - **Related (back-check triangle)**: this is the *cross-thread* back-check (memo A claim ↔ memo B `§N`). Step 4e above covers the intra-memo back-check (memo A summary ↔ memo A detail, #245 / PR #250). The §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" sub-step at step 5 below covers memo A claim ↔ memo A `refs/` (#144 / PR #140 / PR #162). Together the three legs cover the **back-check triangle** — see `rubric.md` §"Cross-thread citation back-check (dim 3)" §"Related (back-check triangle composition)" for the composition contract. The three legs share the structural shape (explicit-skip convention, top-level `_summary.md` block, critical-flag-candidate pathway, `findings.md` subsection, fixture-anchored Phase B) but preserve divergent verdict-tag vocabularies — each leg's vocabulary is canon for that leg.
4g. **Run strongman back-check (Phase A, reviewer-judgment)** — issue #330:
   - This is a **reviewer-prose-only** sub-step in Phase A — no Python module is invoked. Following the §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" precedent (`commands/memo-review.md` step 5, fully reviewer-judgment with no automated `refs/` parsing in v0), the §"Summary-detail consistency" precedent (step 4e above, issue #245 / PR #250), and the §"Cross-thread citation back-check (dim 3)" precedent (step 4f above, issue #236), the reviewer enumerates author-supplied strongman files in the resolved refs-dir list, classifies the memo's treatment of each named objection inside `strongman-against.md`, and emits a structured `strongman_back_check` block + a `findings.md` subsection. No Python detector, no schema change to `anvil/lib/review_schema.py`, no new critic sibling type — the strongman files are author-supplied substrate that live in the research/input layer (`refs/` or `research/<topic>-analysis/`) per SKILL.md §"Source-of-truth materials" §"Strongman scoping convention".
   - **Procedure (three phases)** — mirrors the cross-thread cite back-check shape at step 4f and the strongman dim 3 sub-rule in `rubric.md` §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" §"Strongman back-check (dim 3)":
     1. **Enumerate strongman files** — scan the **resolved refs-dir list** returned by `anvil/skills/memo/lib/refs_resolver.py::resolve_refs_dirs(<thread_dir>)` for `strongman-for.md` and `strongman-against.md` files. Recurse into subdirectories one level deep to catch `refs/<topic>/strongman-{for,against}.md` (single-thesis memo with topic-scoped pairs) AND `<portfolio>/research/<topic>-analysis/strongman-{for,against}.md` (multi-vertical memo with portfolio-level pairs scoped to each vertical's research question — the brasidas-licensing / brains-for-robots canary shape). Record the `summary_location` for each strongman file (e.g., `"refs/strongman-against.md"`, `"research/02-humanoids-analysis/strongman-against.md"`). If no strongman files of either kind are found, record `ran: false` with `reason: "no strongman-for.md or strongman-against.md files found in resolved refs-dir list"` and skip the rest of this step — the reviewer is required to explicitly emit `ran: false` rather than omit the block (same convention as `lint.refs_pdf_extraction`, `lint.memo_deck_parity`, `summary_detail_consistency` at step 4e, and `cross_thread_cite_consistency` at step 4f).
     2. **Enumerate named objections** — for each `strongman-against.md` present, enumerate the load-bearing objections / counter-arguments inside it. The strongman author named them (typically as numbered sections, headings like `## Objection 1: <title>`, or bulleted lists); the reviewer is NOT re-deriving them — the file's structure is the contract. Record each objection's title (or a short excerpt when no title is structured) and its `objection_id` (1-based index within the source file). Note whether each objection is **load-bearing** (the strongman author marked it as thesis-defining or recommendation-shifting, or a sophisticated reader would identify it as a deal-breaker for the cited thesis) or **non-load-bearing** (peripheral or speculative concerns the strongman author included for completeness) per the strongman author's structure and reviewer judgment. `strongman-for.md` does NOT participate in this enumeration — it feeds dim 2 calibration (see "dim 2 calibration note" below), not dim 3 back-check findings.
     3. **Classify each objection** — for each named objection in each `strongman-against.md`, classify the memo's treatment as one of three verdict tags per `rubric.md` §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" §"Strongman back-check (dim 3)":
        - **`ADDRESSED`** — no finding emitted (silent). The memo directly addresses the objection in prose with reasoning that engages the objection on its merits, OR explicitly scopes the objection out of the memo's claim set (e.g., "we acknowledge X as a risk but the memo focuses on Y").
        - **`PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED`** — severity `important`; **-1 dim 3 deduction**. The memo touches on the objection but does not fully engage (e.g., acknowledges the concern without offering a reasoned response, or addresses one facet while leaving others untouched).
        - **`NOT_ADDRESSED`** — the memo neither addresses nor explicitly scopes out the objection. Severity splits on load-bearing-ness:
          - **Load-bearing objection**: severity **`critical`**; **-2 dim 3 deduction AND critical-flag candidate** per the rubric's open-ended "any deal-breaker a sophisticated reader would catch" instruction.
          - **Non-load-bearing objection**: severity `important`; **-1 dim 3 deduction**. Not flag-eligible on its own.
   - **dim 2 calibration note** — for each `strongman-for.md` present, the reviewer's dim 2 *Thesis coherence* justification SHOULD note whether the memo's thesis aligns with the strongest version of its own argument per `rubric.md` §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" §"Strongman back-check (dim 3)" (e.g., "Dim 2 = 6/6: the memo's thesis matches the strongest framing in `refs/strongman-for.md` — the FPGA-as-measurement-instrument framing is preserved verbatim from the strongman through to the recommendation"). `strongman-for.md` does NOT emit findings into the `strongman_back_check` block — it is dim 2 substrate, surfaced via the dim 2 scoring justification at step 5. Record the presence of `strongman-for.md` files in the cached block via `strongman_for_files_scanned` (see below) so the operator and downstream consumers can see at a glance which dim 2 calibration substrate was available.
   - **Cache the structured block** for the `_summary.md` write at step 9 and the `findings.md` write at step 10. Specifically, cache `strongman_block` as:
     - `ran: bool` — `true` when at least one strongman file (for or against) was discovered in the resolved refs-dir list; `false` (with `reason` populated) when no strongman files were found.
     - `strongman_against_files_scanned: list[str]` — relative-path labels for each `strongman-against.md` scanned (e.g., `["refs/strongman-against.md", "research/02-humanoids-analysis/strongman-against.md"]`). Empty list when no `strongman-against.md` is present (the dim 3 back-check is inactive but the block may still emit `ran: true` when `strongman-for.md` is present for dim 2).
     - `strongman_for_files_scanned: list[str]` — relative-path labels for each `strongman-for.md` scanned (e.g., `["refs/strongman-for.md"]`). Surfaced for operator visibility into dim 2 calibration substrate; does not contribute findings.
     - `objections_enumerated: int` — total count of load-bearing + non-load-bearing objections identified across all `strongman-against.md` files.
     - `findings_count: int` — total count of non-`ADDRESSED` findings emitted.
     - `findings_by_severity: {critical, important}` — count of findings per severity bucket. (`suggestion` is not used by this back-check — the strongman vocabulary is 3-valued and severities are constrained to `critical` / `important`.)
     - `findings: list[dict]` — one entry per non-`ADDRESSED` finding. Per-finding fields:
       - `objection_id` (`int`): the 1-based index of the objection within its source `strongman-against.md`.
       - `objection_title` (`str`): the objection's named title or short excerpt (e.g., `"FinFET mask cost dominates Pericles.3 unit economics"`).
       - `strongman_source` (`str`): the relative path to the source file (e.g., `"refs/strongman-against.md"`, `"research/02-humanoids-analysis/strongman-against.md"`).
       - `load_bearing` (`bool`): whether the objection is load-bearing per the strongman author's structure + reviewer judgment.
       - `verdict` (`str`): one of `"PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED"` / `"NOT_ADDRESSED"`. (`"ADDRESSED"` is never emitted in `findings` — silent matches.)
       - `severity` (`str`): one of `"critical"` / `"important"` per the rules above (load-bearing + `NOT_ADDRESSED` → `critical`; otherwise `important`).
       - `dim_3_deduction` (`int`): the per-instance dim 3 deduction (`-1` for `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED` and non-load-bearing `NOT_ADDRESSED`; `-2` for load-bearing `NOT_ADDRESSED`).
       - `justification` (`str`): a human-readable diagnostic naming the objection, the verdict, the load-bearing-ness, the dim 3 deduction, and the reviser-actionable next step (e.g., "Objection 3 (FinFET mask cost dominates Pericles.3 unit economics) is NOT_ADDRESSED in the memo body; the cost question is load-bearing for the recommendation — -2 dim 3 + critical flag; reviser should either model the mask cost in §6 or explicitly scope it out of the recommendation").
     - `critical_flag_candidate: bool` — convenience flag for step 7 verdict aggregation. MUST equal `any(f.verdict == "NOT_ADDRESSED" and f.load_bearing and f.severity == "critical" for f in findings)`. Implementer convention; not duplicated state.
   - **Cache `strongman_critical_flag = strongman_block.critical_flag_candidate`** for the verdict logic at step 7. A `NOT_ADDRESSED` finding on a load-bearing objection (severity `critical`) surfaces as a `Strongman: NOT_ADDRESSED (load-bearing)` critical flag in `verdict.md` (see step 10) and forces `advance: false` via the existing critical-flag pathway. `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED` findings and non-load-bearing `NOT_ADDRESSED` findings at `important` severity are observational only — the per-instance dim 3 deduction is the natural surface; they do NOT force `advance: false` on their own.
   - **Backwards-compat**: when the resolved refs-dir list contains no strongman files of either kind, the block is `{ran: false, reason: "no strongman-for.md or strongman-against.md files found in resolved refs-dir list"}` and downstream consumers MUST tolerate the absence — same convention as `summary_detail_consistency` / `cross_thread_cite_consistency`. A memo authored before the strongman convention was formalized (issue #330) is unaffected. A memo where the operator wrote `strongman-for.md` but no `strongman-against.md` produces `ran: true` with an empty `findings` list (and the dim 2 calibration note fires at step 5); a memo with `strongman-against.md` but no `strongman-for.md` produces `ran: true` with whatever findings the back-check identifies (and no dim 2 calibration note fires).
   - **Related (back-check triangle composition)**: this is a **substrate-driven** back-check that sits alongside the three legs of the existing back-check triangle (memo A claim ↔ memo A `refs/` at step 5; memo A summary ↔ memo A §N at step 4e; memo A claim ↔ memo B §N at step 4f). The strongman back-check is structurally a fourth leg — memo A claim-set ↔ author-named objections in `refs/strongman-against.md` — that closes the gap between "the memo addresses the evidence on hand" (the triangle) and "the memo addresses the strongest counter-arguments the author or operator has identified" (this leg). See `rubric.md` §"Refs back-check (dim 3)" §"Strongman back-check (dim 3)" for the rubric-side contract.
4h. **Load `rubric_overrides` from the per-doc BRIEF entry** — issue #233 / #265, consolidated under #296:
   - Invoke `anvil/skills/memo/lib/project_brief.py::load_rubric_overrides_for_slug(<project_dir>, <slug>)`. The project dir is the **parent of the thread dir** (the directory that contains `BRIEF.md`, NOT the thread root itself and NOT a version subdirectory). The slug is the thread's directory name. The loader returns a `RubricOverrides` instance per the schema documented in `project_brief.py`'s module docstring.
   - The returned object carries:
     - `memo_subtype: Optional[str]` — free-string label naming the shape (e.g., `"synthesis-brief"`, `"feedback-memo"`, `"decision-framework"`). Opaque to the reviewer logic; recorded in the `_summary.md.rubric_overrides` block for audit-trail visibility (see step 9).
     - `calibrations: List[CalibrationOverride]` — per-dimension calibration entries (the load-bearing data: each entry is `(dimension: int 1-9, text: str)`).
     - `target_length: Optional[TargetLengthRange]` — optional subtype-scoped override of the document's `target_length` field. **NOT consumed by `memo-review`** — the reviewer's dim 7 anchor is `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.metadata.target_length_resolved` per step 4, written by the drafter / reviser. The `rubric_overrides.target_length` field is the **drafter / reviser** consumer surface. This separation is documented in `project_brief.py`'s docstring §"Validation discipline": `rubric_overrides.target_length` is the *subtype calibration* surface; the per-version surface lives in the per-doc `target_length_overrides` block.
     - `unknown_keys: Dict[str, Any]` — forward-compat passthrough (any key the loader didn't recognize). Surfaced via `warnings.warn` from the loader; surfaced in `_summary.md.rubric_overrides.unknown_keys` for operator visibility.
   - **Graceful-degrade when absent**: the loader returns an empty `RubricOverrides` (every field `None` / empty) for any of: missing BRIEF.md, malformed BRIEF, BRIEF that does not list this slug, BRIEF entry without a `rubric_overrides:` block. The lenient form is the production contract — a consumer typo in BRIEF.md never breaks the lifecycle. The reviewer's behavior on an empty `RubricOverrides` is **byte-identical** to the pre-#233 status quo: no suffixes attached, no `_summary.md.rubric_overrides` block emitted (or emitted with `ran: false`).
   - **Cache the `RubricOverrides` instance** for the scoring write at step 5 and the `_summary.md` write at step 9. The instance is read-only from this point — no mutation.
4i. **Load artifact-type rubric overlay (issue #286, sub-deliverable 3 of #283; absorbs closed #278)**:
   - Invoke `anvil/skills/memo/lib/rubric_overlays.py::select_overlay_for_thread(<thread_dir>)`. The function walks up to find a project-level `BRIEF.md` (the portfolio-as-thread-root layout shipped via #284), locates the thread's slug in the BRIEF's `documents:` list, reads its declared `artifact_type` (one of `investment-memo`, `position-paper`, `tactical-plan`, `vision-document`, `descriptive-thesis`), and loads the matching overlay JSON from `anvil/skills/memo/rubric_overlays/<artifact-type>.json`.
   - The returned `RubricOverlay` carries:
     - `artifact_type: ArtifactType` — the registered enum value.
     - `weight_adjustments: dict[str, int]` — sparse dict of `dim_N` → integer delta applied to the base rubric weight. The reviewer applies the delta when scoring each affected dimension and clamps to non-negative integers (no shipped overlay drives any dim below 0). The verbatim adjustments are recorded in `_summary.md.rubric_overlay.weight_adjustments` for audit-trail visibility.
     - `calibration_prose: dict[str, str]` — sparse dict of `dim_N` → prose string. For each affected dimension, the reviewer appends the prose verbatim to its `scoring.md` justification as a calibration suffix, mirroring the per-thread `rubric_overrides.dim_N_calibration` mechanism (issue #233). Composition order is overlay-first then per-thread: `<base justification>` + ` [overlay: <overlay prose>]` + ` [thread: <per-thread prose>]`. When both surfaces target the same dim, both suffixes appear so the audit trail records which surface contributed which calibration.
   - **Graceful-degrade when absent**: `select_overlay_for_thread` returns `None` for any of: thread that does not live inside a project root (no project BRIEF on the walk-upward path — a stray thread under #295), thread slug not listed in the BRIEF's `documents:` block, or a BRIEF that fails to parse. In all of these cases the reviewer behaves byte-identically to the pre-#286 status quo — no weight adjustments, no overlay suffix, no `_summary.md.rubric_overlay` block (or emitted with `ran: false`).
   - **Identity overlay**: the `investment-memo` overlay is identity (zero weight adjustments, empty calibration prose) so a thread with `artifact_type: investment-memo` in the project BRIEF behaves byte-identically to a thread with no project BRIEF at all. The verdict comment surfaces `Applying rubric overlay: investment-memo (identity)` for transparency; the reviewer's scoring logic is unaffected.
   - **Cache the `RubricOverlay`** (or `None`) for the scoring write at step 5 and the `_summary.md` write at step 9. The instance is read-only from this point — no mutation.
4j. **Load `recommendation_target` from the thread-level `<thread>/BRIEF.md`** — issue #348:
   - Invoke `anvil/skills/memo/lib/project_brief.py::load_recommendation_target(<thread_dir>)`. The thread dir is the **directory containing `BRIEF.md` and the `<thread>.{N}/` version dirs**, NOT a version subdirectory and NOT the project root (which carries a separate project-level `BRIEF.md` per #296). The two `BRIEF.md` surfaces are distinct: project-level BRIEF carries the typed `documents:` schema (`artifact_type`, `target_length`, `rubric_overrides`); thread-level BRIEF is freeform prose with optional informal YAML frontmatter (`company`, `sector`, `stage`, `check_size`, `recommendation_target`). This step reads ONLY the thread-level BRIEF.
   - The loader returns one of:
     - `"undecided"` — the operator has explicitly declared the thread is in **pre-decision mode** (the documented fresh-thread default per `templates/BRIEF.fresh.md.example`: *"The job of v1 is to resolve the recommendation target, not to defend a predetermined one"*). The dim 1 scoring at step 5 applies the decision-framework calibration documented in `rubric.md` §"Dim 1 — `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration".
     - `"invest"` / `"pass"` / `"conditional"` — the operator has declared a decided posture; dim 1 scores against the standard "single unambiguous recommendation" calibration verbatim (byte-identical to pre-#348 behavior).
     - `None` — the field is absent, malformed, or set to an unrecognized value (a typo like `Undecided`, `tbd`, `?`); the calibration does not fire; dim 1 scores against the standard calibration verbatim.
   - **Lenient by design**: the loader never raises. Every absence / malformed path resolves to `None`, mirroring `load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`'s contract. This is the load-bearing backwards-compat: a thread with no BRIEF, no frontmatter, no `recommendation_target` key, or a typo in the value behaves byte-identically to a thread that pre-dates this helper.
   - **Cache the resolved value** as `recommendation_target_resolved` for the dim 1 scoring at step 5 and the `_summary.md` write at step 9. The cached value is one of `"undecided"` / `"invest"` / `"pass"` / `"conditional"` / `None`.
5. **Score each dimension** (1–9 per rubric):
   - Assign an integer between 0 and the dimension's weight.
   - Write a 1–3 sentence justification citing specific evidence (heading, excerpt, exhibit) from the memo.
   - Record per-dimension result in `scoring.md` as a markdown table with columns `# | Dimension | Weight | Score | Justification`.
   - **Dim 1 (Recommendation clarity) `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration sub-step** (issue #348): when the cached `recommendation_target_resolved` from step 4j equals `"undecided"`, the reviewer applies the **decision-framework scoring posture** documented in `rubric.md` §"Dim 1 — `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration" verbatim. Specifically: dim 1 scores on (a) whether the memo names the load-bearing decision being made, (b) whether it enumerates the open questions a sophisticated reader would need answered to land on invest / pass / conditional, and (c) whether it states what specific evidence would flip the decision in each direction (the falsifiability contract from `templates/BRIEF.fresh.md.example` line 93). The five-point ladder (5/5 → 0/5) is documented verbatim in `rubric.md` and SHOULD be cited in the reviewer's scoring rationale. The reviewer MUST append the verbatim suffix `"recommendation_target: undecided — scoring dim 1 on decision-framework clarity, not recommendation clarity"` to the dim 1 `scoring.md` justification so the audit trail records why the calibration fired. **Suffix order** (when multiple surfaces fire on dim 1): base reviewer-prose justification → artifact-type overlay suffix (if any) → `recommendation_target: undecided` suffix (this sub-step) → per-doc `dim_1_calibration` suffix (if any). The per-doc-wins ordering from the existing §"Per-doc recalibration for non-investment-memo shapes" precedent is preserved. **Inert when not triggered**: when `recommendation_target_resolved` is `None`, `"invest"`, `"pass"`, or `"conditional"`, this sub-step does NOT fire — no suffix is appended, no calibration is applied, and dim 1 scores against the standard "single unambiguous recommendation" calibration in the rubric table at the top of `rubric.md` (byte-identical to pre-#348 behavior). The `_summary.md.recommendation_target_resolved.applied` field (see step 9) records whether the calibration fired so the audit trail is reproducible.
   - **Dim 9 (Rhetorical economy) `scope: reduce` echo sub-step (issue #242)**: when dim 9 scores below full weight (4/4), the rubric requires the reviewer to cite specific anti-pattern instances in the dim 9 justification (multi-paragraph hedges, oversized footnotes, restated subsections, redundant tables, reformulated open-decisions entries, restated bullet lists — per `rubric.md` §"Dim 9 — rhetorical economy"). For every cited instance, the reviewer MUST ALSO surface that instance as a `scope: reduce` entry in `comments.md` (see step 8) — the two surfaces stay coherent: `scoring.md` says "-2 on §4.2's three-paragraph hedge"; `comments.md` echoes the same §4.2 instance as a `scope: reduce` comment with the suggested trim. This is the **mechanical surfacing path** from rubric-side anti-pattern citation to operator-visible comment stream: without the echo, the reviser sees the dim 9 deduction in `scoring.md` but has no `comments.md` entry to act on, and the named instances stay locked in score-justification prose the reviser may not parse. The echo is **per-instance**: each named anti-pattern instance becomes one `scope: reduce` comment, severity matching the load-bearing-ness of the instance (typically `major` for thesis-block bloat, `minor` for tangential bloat). When dim 9 scores 4/4 (full weight) the echo is inactive — there are no instances to surface.
   - **Dim 3 (Evidence quality) refs back-check sub-step**: enumerate the **resolved refs-dir list** returned by `anvil/skills/memo/lib/refs_resolver.py::resolve_refs_dirs(<thread_dir>)` — `[<thread>/refs/]` for the legacy single-thread shape, OR `[<thread>/refs/, <portfolio>/research/]` for the portfolio-shared shape (issue #280) when a sibling `<portfolio>/research/` directory exists. Iterate ALL resolved directories (not just `<thread>/refs/`) and partition the union of entries into (a) **source-of-truth materials** — files named for their content (`cv.pdf`, `cv.md`, `transcript-*.md`, `filing-*.pdf`, `paper-*.pdf`, `email-*.md`, `image-*.{png,jpg}`, `prior/<vN>.{pdf,md}`, portfolio-level files like `comps/silicon-comp-matrix.md` and `00-*.md` vertical briefs) per SKILL.md §"Source-of-truth materials" — and (b) **citation stubs** — files matching the `<key>.md` shape with `# TODO: source for <claim>` content per SKILL.md §"Citation stubs". The back-check applies ONLY to source-of-truth materials; citation stubs are out of scope for this sub-step (they are scored under §"Citation hooks (dim 3)" per the existing per-instance deduction). **Per-thread precedence on filename collision**: when the same basename exists in both `<thread>/refs/` and `<portfolio>/research/`, the per-thread copy wins (the resolver returns it first; the reviewer picks the first match when iterating). The verdict-tag prose surfaces which layer the evidence came from via the `-> <refs-dir-basename>/<file>` shape (see below). For each source-of-truth refs-document **type** present in the union (one CV, one filing, one transcript, one comp-matrix, etc.), pick at least one biographical or factual claim in `<thread>.md` whose evidentiary basis is the document's subject, and write a `comments.md` entry of the form:
     ```
     claim: "<excerpt from <thread>.md>"
       -> <refs-dir-basename>/<file>      # `refs/<file>` for per-thread hits; `research/<file>` for portfolio-level hits (issue #280)
       -> verdict: <VERIFIED | UNVERIFIED | CONTRADICTED | NOT-IN-REFS>
       -> <one-line justification, citing the line/passage in <refs-dir-basename>/<file> when CONTRADICTED or VERIFIED>
     ```
     Verdict tags:
     - **`VERIFIED`** — claim matches the source-of-truth document; no deduction.
     - **`UNVERIFIED`** — refs/ document is present and on-topic but does not contain the supporting passage (claim is unsupported but not contradicted); 1-point dim 3 deduction.
     - **`CONTRADICTED`** — refs/ document contains a passage that **directly contradicts** the claim (e.g., memo says "Sphere Staff Scientist tenure 15+ years" but `refs/cv.pdf` shows "Sphere Semi, Palo Alto CA, 2026-current"); 2-point dim 3 deduction AND a **critical-flag candidate** per the rubric's open-ended "any deal-breaker a sophisticated reader would catch" instruction. Reviewers SHOULD set the critical flag for any CONTRADICTED claim in a load-bearing section (team, financials, traction, technical thesis).
     - **`NOT-IN-REFS`** — the memo makes a claim, but no source-of-truth refs-document on-disk covers the claim's subject. Informational only (no deduction); records "where did this come from" visibility.
     The reviewer is **not required to back-check every claim** — that would re-litigate the whole memo — but is required to back-check **at least one claim per refs-document type present**. When `refs/` contains no source-of-truth materials (only citation stubs, or empty), this sub-step is **inactive** and dim 3 falls back to the citation-hooks behavior alone (backward-compat with PR #140).

     **PDF refs back-check (opt-in via `pdftotext`, issue #167)**: call `anvil/skills/memo/lib/refs_pdf.py::check_pdftotext_available()`. When it returns `True`, extract each `*.pdf` file in the resolved refs-dir list (per-thread `<thread>/refs/*.pdf` AND portfolio-level `<portfolio>/research/*.pdf` and any subdirectory `*.pdf` therein — issue #280) to text via `extract_pdf_text(...)` and apply the same `VERIFIED` / `UNVERIFIED` / `CONTRADICTED` / `NOT-IN-REFS` verdict-tag rubric above against the extracted text directly — PDFs become first-class back-check sources, no sibling `.md` companion required. When extraction returns an empty string (image-based / scanned PDF), log an info-level note (`refs/<file>.pdf` produced no extractable text — likely image-based; would need OCR for back-check) and fall back to presence-only handling for that specific file — no deduction either way; this is an operator-facing visibility note. When `check_pdftotext_available()` returns `False`, PDFs and images are treated as **presence-only** (the v0 fallback shipped in PR #162) — the reviewer notes the file is on-disk and the memo's claim about its subject is `UNVERIFIED` unless the operator has surfaced the relevant passage in `BRIEF.md` or a sibling `.md` companion (e.g., a `cv.md` next to `cv.pdf`). In the `check_pdftotext_available() == False` path, the reviewer additionally records an info-level lint entry in `_summary.md.lint.refs_pdf_extraction` (see step 9) carrying the remediation install story from `refs_pdf.PDFTOTEXT_REMEDIATION` so the consumer sees how to enable the back-check on the next run. Images (`.png` / `.jpg`) remain presence-only in all paths in v0 (OCR / vision back-check is deferred per the issue body).

     **Cross-thread reference validation (issue #287 — sub-deliverable 4 of #283)**: scan `<thread>.{N}/<thread>.md` for cross-thread references of the form `[[../<other-slug>/<other-slug>.latest]]` and `[[../<other-slug>/<other-slug>.N]]` (with optional `/<thread>.md` or `/exhibits/<file>` suffix) via `anvil/skills/memo/lib/cross_thread_refs.py::find_cross_thread_refs(memo_text)` and resolve each one against the portfolio root (`<thread_dir>.parent`) via `resolve_cross_thread_ref(ref, portfolio_root)` (or use the convenience batch helper `resolve_cross_thread_refs(memo_text, portfolio_root)`). The resolver tolerates `.latest` as either a symlink, a real directory, OR (when neither exists) a walk-to-highest fallback that picks the highest-numbered `<other-slug>.<N>/` sibling — this works today regardless of sub-deliverable 5 (#288)'s `.latest` symlink convention. For each unresolved cross-thread ref (`reason` of `"thread not found"`, `"version not found"`, `"file not found"`, or `"latest unresolvable"`), record a `comments.md` entry of the form:

     ```
     claim: "<excerpt from <thread>.md including the unresolved [[../...]] ref>"
       -> <other-slug>/<file>        # citation-token vocabulary for cross-thread refs (recommended)
       -> verdict: UNRESOLVED (<reason>)
       -> <one-line justification — name the resolution failure and the on-disk gap>
     ```

     The citation-token vocabulary `[<other-slug>/<file>]` matches the existing `[refs/<file>]` (per-thread) and `[research/<file>]` (portfolio) patterns from issue #280 — one less special case for the reviser and downstream tooling to learn. Apply a **per-instance dim 3 deduction proportional to the unresolved count** — `-1` per unresolved ref, matching the `UNVERIFIED` precedent for the `refs/` back-check above. The deduction is cumulative across multiple unresolved refs (a memo with three unresolved cross-thread refs takes `-3` on dim 3). Resolved cross-thread refs are observed silently (no comment, no deduction); their successful resolution is the positive signal under dim 3's full-weight calibration.

     The dim 3 justification MUST cite the unresolved ref(s) and the resolution failure (e.g., "Unresolved cross-thread ref `[[../brasidas-synthesis/brasidas-synthesis.99]]` (<thread>.md line 47): version not found — brasidas-synthesis only has versions .1 and .2 on disk; -1"). Vague "cross-thread refs broken" deductions without named refs are not actionable for the reviser and SHOULD be avoided — same standard as the rest of dim 3's sub-rules. **Backward compatibility**: when `find_cross_thread_refs(memo_text)` returns an empty list (the common case — many threads do not cite siblings), this sub-step is **inactive** and dim 3 falls back to the citation-hooks + refs back-check behavior alone. Byte-identical pre-#287 behavior for any memo without cross-thread refs.
   - **Dim 7 (Scope discipline) length comparison**: compute the word count of `<thread>.md` (a simple `len(<thread>.md.split())` is sufficient; the reviewer may strip code-fence content and YAML frontmatter before counting if they meaningfully distort the body length). If `target_length` is set, compare the actual word count against the declared `[min, max]` range and apply the following calibration:
     - **In range** (`min <= actual <= max`): no length-driven deduction; score on the other scope-discipline criteria (no kitchen-sink appendices, no scope creep into adjacent deals).
     - **Modest deviation** (within ~15% of the nearest endpoint): note in the justification but do not flag — soft target.
     - **Meaningful deviation** (>~15% over `max` or under `min`): deduct on dim 7 and call out the deviation explicitly in the justification.
     The dim 7 justification MUST record **both the declared target and the actual count** (e.g., "Target 1800–2400 words; actual 2050 — in range" or "Target 1800–2400 words; actual 3400 — 42% over upper bound"). When the resolved source is `"overrides.<N>"`, append the provenance to the declared-target clause so the reader can see which override fired (e.g., "Target 2000–2800 words (from overrides.10); actual 2389 — in range"). When the source is `"default"`, the provenance parenthetical MAY be omitted — it matches the implicit "doc-level default" reading and adding the tag adds noise without information. When `target_length` is unset (source `"none"`), the dim 7 justification falls back to the implicit "reasonable for the decision being made" judgment as today, with no length numbers required.

     **Rendered page count as second-layer advisory** (Phase 4 / issue #196): when `render_gate_block` (cached at step 4c) is present AND `render_gate_block.pages` is non-null, append the rendered page count to the dim 7 justification alongside the word count (e.g., "Target 1800–2400 words; actual 2050 (3 rendered pages) — in range"). Per `rubric.md` §"Length targets" §"Word count is primary; rendered page count is second-layer advisory", the word count is the primary measure and the rendered page count is a second-layer advisory signal — the two MAY disagree, and when they do the reviewer judges which is binding (word count wins for the typical markdown-first memo; rendered page count is binding only when the operator declared `target_length.pages` explicitly). When the word count is in range but the rendered page count is out of range (e.g., 2050 words within `[1800, 2400]` but 5 rendered pages because of an oversized figure), record both numbers and note the rendered overflow as advisory in the dim 7 justification (e.g., "Target 1800–2400 words; actual 2050 (5 rendered pages — second-layer advisory, see `_summary.md.render_gate`) — in range on the primary signal"). When `render_gate_block.ran == false` (no render_gate block on disk — legal pre-Phase-3 or pre-render state), the rendered-page parenthetical is omitted and dim 7 falls back to word-count-only judgment.

   **Rubric overrides (rubric_overrides) — calibration suffixes** (issue #233 / #265): for each dimension N with a `dim_N_calibration` declared in the cached `RubricOverrides` (step 4h), append the verbatim calibration text as a suffix to that dimension's justification BEFORE writing it to `scoring.md`. The contract:

   - **Suffix shape (verbatim)**: `"<reviewer-prose-justification> calibration applied: <override text>"`. A single space separates the reviewer prose from the suffix; the prefix `"calibration applied: "` (with trailing space) is the load-bearing anchor a downstream consumer greps for. The override text is reproduced **byte-for-byte verbatim** — no rewording, no truncation, no whitespace normalization. The author's exact wording is the audit trail.
   - **Empty justification handling**: when the reviewer wrote no justification body for a dimension (e.g., full-weight score without prose), the suffix becomes the entire justification: `"calibration applied: <override text>"`. The calibration MUST still appear in the audit trail even when the reviewer's own prose is absent.
   - **Per-dimension dispatch**: ONLY dimensions with `dim_N_calibration` declared carry the suffix. Dimensions without a calibration are byte-identical to their pre-#233 form. A reviewer that sets calibrations for dims 1, 5, 6, 7 (the brasidas-synthesis canary) sees suffixes on those four; dims 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 are unchanged.
   - **Mechanical helper**: `anvil/skills/memo/lib/rubric_overrides_suffix.py::apply_calibration_to_justification(justification, overrides, dimension)` (single dim) or `apply_calibrations_to_scores(scores, overrides)` (batch) implements the suffix shape. The reviewer agent SHOULD invoke the helper rather than reproducing the suffix format by hand — the helper is the schema-of-record for the format. Calling sites: at the end of the per-dim scoring loop (step 5), after the reviewer has written its own prose justification, run the cached `RubricOverrides` through the helper and use the returned suffix-appended string as the `scoring.md` table cell.
   - **Zero-impact when `rubric_overrides` is absent** (AC3 of #265): the helper returns the input justification byte-for-byte unchanged when `overrides` is `None` OR `overrides.is_empty == True`. The reviewer's per-dim scoring write path is byte-identical to its pre-#233 behavior for legacy threads. This is the load-bearing backwards-compat contract for the ~90% of threads that do not declare `rubric_overrides`.
   - **Dim 7 interaction**: when `target_length` is declared inside `rubric_overrides`, the reviewer's dim 7 anchor is STILL the resolved range cached at step 4 (from `_progress.json.metadata.target_length_resolved` or the BRIEF-entry fallback). The `rubric_overrides.target_length` field is consumed by `memo-draft` and `memo-revise` (the drafter / reviser) — they write the resolved range into `_progress.json.metadata.target_length_resolved` for the next version, and `memo-review` reads that resolved field per step 4. So `rubric_overrides.target_length` participates indirectly via the existing pinning mechanism. A `dim_7_calibration` (separate from `target_length`) attaches as a suffix per the rules above.

   **Worked example** — brasidas-synthesis canary (`memo_subtype: "synthesis-brief"`, the worked example from issue #233; the structured config now lives on the per-doc BRIEF entry per #296):

   In `<project>/BRIEF.md`'s `documents:` list:
   ```yaml
   - slug: brasidas-synthesis
     artifact_type: descriptive-thesis
     target_length: { words: [9000, 13000] }
     rubric_overrides:
       memo_subtype: synthesis-brief
       dim_1_calibration: >-
         decision-framework — score on framework clarity + sub-recommendation
         sharpness, not on single ranked recommendation
       dim_5_calibration: >-
         defers to underlying market models — score on integration quality
         not on fresh sizing
       dim_6_calibration: >-
         defers to underlying market models — score on whether financial
         framing supports positioning
       dim_7_calibration: >-
         target length 9000-13000 words; score against declared target
       target_length: { words: [9000, 13000] }
   ```

   Resulting `scoring.md` table rows (only the affected dims shown):
   ```
   | # | Dimension                 | Weight | Score | Justification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   |---|---------------------------|--------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | 1 | Recommendation clarity    | 5      | 5     | Brief commits to 5 sharp sub-recommendations and explicitly defers portfolio-shape choice to the CEO; the framework itself is unambiguous. calibration applied: decision-framework — score on framework clarity + sub-recommendation sharpness, not on single ranked recommendation |
   | 5 | Market & competitive framing | 4   | 4     | Synthesis correctly integrates per-vertical market models without re-doing the sizing work — references all 5 verticals with appropriate weight. calibration applied: defers to underlying market models — score on integration quality not on fresh sizing |
   | 6 | Financial reasoning       | 5      | 5     | Financial framing supports the recommendation framework without re-modeling; defers to the underlying per-vertical scenario math. calibration applied: defers to underlying market models — score on whether financial framing supports positioning |
   | 7 | Scope discipline          | 4      | 4     | Target 9000-13000 words; actual 11,247 — in range. Synthesis stays within scope of the analytical bundle. calibration applied: target length 9000-13000 words; score against declared target |
   ```

   Dims 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 carry their normal reviewer-prose justifications with NO suffix attached (no calibration declared for those dims). The verdict + advance logic at step 7 is unchanged — the suffix is audit-trail commentary, not a score modifier.
6. **Identify critical flags**: review the memo against the 4 example flags in `rubric.md` AND the open-ended "any deal-breaker a sophisticated reader would catch" instruction. For each flag set, write a one-paragraph justification in `verdict.md`.
7. **Compute total**: sum all dimension scores. `advance = (total >= 35) AND (no critical flags) AND (lint.errors == 0)`. When the pre-flight image-reference lint (step 4b) reports `errors > 0`, `advance` is forced `false` and the verdict lists `Memo image refs (lint)` under critical flags. The rubric total is reported honestly but does not save the verdict — a memo that references files that do not exist is not advance-eligible regardless of its prose quality.

   **Append `score_history` row with `rubric_id` (issue #346)**: the orchestrator (the command that drives review→revise iterations) appends one row to `<thread>.{N}/_progress.json.metadata.score_history` per finished review iteration. Per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` §"Convergence fields → score_history", the canonical row shape is `{iteration, total, threshold, rubric_id}` — for the memo skill at /44, that's `{iteration: <N>, total: <computed-total>, threshold: 35, rubric_id: "anvil-memo-v2"}`. A thread that spans the `/40 → /44` migration records different `rubric_id` values across its rows (e.g., rows 1–2 may carry `"anvil-memo-v1"` from legacy reviews and rows 3+ carry `"anvil-memo-v2"` from post-migration reviews); readers tolerate rows missing `rubric_id` per the backwards-compat contract (treat as `"unknown/legacy"`). See `convergence.check_stable` for the precedent on `None`-tolerance.

   **Summary-detail consistency critical flag (issue #245)**: when the cached `summary_detail_critical_flag` from step 4e is `true` (i.e., the back-check identified at least one `CONTRADICTED` finding at `critical` severity), append a critical flag named `Summary-detail consistency: CONTRADICTED` to the verdict's critical-flag list with the claim excerpt + the contradicting detail location as the one-paragraph justification. This flag is set via the existing critical-flag-candidate pathway, NOT via a new gate — the existing `advance` aggregation (`(total >= 35) AND (no critical flags) AND (lint.errors == 0)`) is unchanged; the back-check plugs into the "no critical flags" clause exactly like the §"Refs back-check" `CONTRADICTED` precedent. `ABSENT` and `DIVERGENT` findings at `important` / `suggestion` severity are observational only — they do NOT contribute to the critical-flag list and do NOT force `advance: false` on their own.

   **Cross-thread cite back-check critical flag (issue #236)**: when the cached `cross_thread_cite_critical_flag` from step 4f is `true` (i.e., the back-check identified at least one `ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` finding at `critical` severity), append a critical flag named `Cross-thread cite: ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` to the verdict's critical-flag list with the cite text + the contradicting cited-section location as the one-paragraph justification. This flag is set via the existing critical-flag-candidate pathway, NOT via a new gate — the existing `advance` aggregation (`(total >= 35) AND (no critical flags) AND (lint.errors == 0)`) is unchanged; the back-check plugs into the "no critical flags" clause exactly like the §"Refs back-check" `CONTRADICTED` precedent and the §"Summary-detail consistency" `CONTRADICTED` precedent. `ANCHOR-MISSING-BUT-THREAD-PRESENT` and `THREAD-NOT-FOUND` findings at `important` severity are observational only — they do NOT contribute to the critical-flag list and do NOT force `advance: false` on their own (the per-instance dim 3 deduction is the natural surface).

   **Strongman back-check critical flag (issue #330)**: when the cached `strongman_critical_flag` from step 4g is `true` (i.e., the back-check identified at least one `NOT_ADDRESSED` finding on a load-bearing objection at `critical` severity), append a critical flag named `Strongman: NOT_ADDRESSED (load-bearing)` to the verdict's critical-flag list with the objection title + the source `strongman-against.md` path as the one-paragraph justification. This flag is set via the existing critical-flag-candidate pathway, NOT via a new gate — the existing `advance` aggregation (`(total >= 35) AND (no critical flags) AND (lint.errors == 0)`) is unchanged; the back-check plugs into the "no critical flags" clause exactly like the §"Refs back-check" `CONTRADICTED` precedent, the §"Summary-detail consistency" `CONTRADICTED` precedent, and the §"Cross-thread cite" `ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` precedent. `PARTIALLY_ADDRESSED` findings and non-load-bearing `NOT_ADDRESSED` findings at `important` severity are observational only — they do NOT contribute to the critical-flag list and do NOT force `advance: false` on their own (the per-instance dim 3 deduction is the natural surface).
8. **Write line-level comments**: in `comments.md`, list specific feedback keyed to memo sections — heading reference + short excerpt + comment. Group by severity (`blocker` / `major` / `minor` / `nit`).

   **Scope tagging (issue #242, Phase A — reviewer-prose-only)**: every comment carries a `scope: preserve | expand | reduce` label alongside its severity grouping. The label appears in the comment heading directly so the operator can scan/filter at a glance and the reviser at #241 can read scope + severity together. See `rubric.md` §"Scope tagging (comments.md)" for the three-valued vocabulary, the dim 9 echo rule, the expand-trim-candidate rule, and the backwards-compat fallback. Shape:

   ```
   ### §4.2 (line 187) — scope: reduce, major
   Excerpt: "Three-paragraph hedge on PAM4/FEC tradeoffs..."
   Comment: Could land in one sentence per dim 9 §"Multi-paragraph hedges where one sentence carries the load."
   ```

   The three values:

   - **`scope: preserve`** — the comment proposes a change that neither adds nor removes content (e.g., reword for clarity, fix a typo, swap a noun for a sharper noun, reorder paragraphs without compression). Default when the comment does not propose adding or removing content.
   - **`scope: expand`** — the comment proposes ADDING content (a new paragraph, a new subsection, a new exhibit, a new risk entry, a new financial-scenario row, a new citation expansion).
   - **`scope: reduce`** — the comment proposes REMOVING or COMPRESSING content (collapse a three-paragraph hedge to one sentence, drop a redundant subsection, trim a restated bullet list, replace a worked-example table with a one-line rule statement, fold an oversized footnote into a parenthetical).

   **Required `scope: reduce` echoes from dim 9 (issue #242 AC 2)**: every dim 9 anti-pattern instance cited in `scoring.md` (per step 5's echo sub-step) MUST appear as a `scope: reduce` `comments.md` entry. The two surfaces stay coherent: when dim 9 scored less than 4/4, the `scope: reduce` subset of `comments.md` is **non-empty** AND each entry cites a specific instance with a suggested trim. Severity matches the load-bearing-ness of the instance (typically `major` for thesis-block bloat, `minor` for tangential bloat).

   **`scope: expand` trim-candidate rule (issue #242 AC 3)**: any `scope: expand` comment that proposes adding **≥1 paragraph** or **≥1 subsection** MUST identify what could be trimmed to fund the addition. Two acceptable forms:

   1. Name an existing paragraph / subsection to compress, OR
   2. Explicitly acknowledge that the addition fits within dim 9's budget without compression cost (e.g., "The risk section currently runs short — adding this risk fits without trimming elsewhere.").

   Comments lacking the trim-candidate clause are **automatically downgraded from `major` to `minor`** — the bar for unconditional expansion at `major` severity is "the dim 9 budget can absorb it." A `scope: expand` comment at `minor` severity does NOT carry the trim-candidate requirement (the additive cost is small enough that the budget is implicit). A `scope: expand` comment at `nit` severity (single-word / single-clause additions like a missing definition or a one-line clarification) is also exempt.

   **Heading shape**: the `scope` label appears in the comment heading after the severity, separated by a comma:

   ```
   ### <heading reference> (<location>) — scope: <preserve|expand|reduce>, <blocker|major|minor|nit>
   Excerpt: "<short excerpt>"
   Comment: <comment text>
   ```

   The comment groupings by severity (`blocker` / `major` / `minor` / `nit`) MAY remain as top-level `## Severity: <severity>` subsections; the scope label is per-comment inside those groupings. Alternatively the reviewer MAY group by scope at the top level (`## Scope: reduce` / `## Scope: expand` / `## Scope: preserve`) with severity per-comment — the choice is reviewer judgment and not load-bearing for the contract; the requirement is that BOTH scope and severity appear on every comment.

   **Backwards-compat (issue #242 AC 6)**: a review sibling produced **before** this contract shipped does NOT need to be re-emitted and remains a legal historical record. The reviser at #241 reads `scope` when present and falls back to severity-only when absent (mirrors the perspective-sibling backwards-compat pattern in `rubric.md` §"Perspective substrate (dim 3)" §"Without perspective"). New reviews produced after this contract ships MUST carry scope labels per the rules above.
9. **Write `_summary.md`** as a JSON-in-markdown scorecard. The `lint` block is populated from the cached `LintResult` returned by step 4b, the `refs_pdf_extraction` block reflects the PDF refs back-check path (step 5, issue #167), and the `render_gate` block reflects the cached `render_gate_block` from step 4c (Phase 4 / issue #196):
   ```markdown

   ```
   - The top-level `rubric` block (issue #346) carries the rubric the reviewer scored against, so a downstream consumer aggregating across versions does not need to walk back to the skill's `rubric.md` file (which may have changed between v3 and v5 of a long thread that spanned the `/40 → /44` migration). The block lives at the **top level** of `_summary.md` (sibling to `lint`, `render_gate`, `summary_detail_consistency`, `cross_thread_cite_consistency`, `scope_distribution`, `rubric_overrides`, and `strongman_back_check`). Shape:
     - `id` (`str`): the rubric identifier — `"anvil-memo-v2"` for the current /44 rubric. Mirrors `_meta.json.rubric_id` for self-describing per-review metadata.
     - `total` (`int`): the rubric's declared `total` (point pool) — `44` for the current memo rubric. Mirrors `_meta.json.rubric_total`.
     - `advance_threshold` (`int`): the rubric's declared advance threshold — `35` for the current memo rubric. Mirrors `_meta.json.advance_threshold`.
     - `dimensions` (`int`): the count of weighted dimensions on the rubric — `9` for the current /44 memo rubric.
     - `prior_rubric_id` (`str | null`, conditional): present when the prior review sibling at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` exists. The value is the prior `_meta.json.rubric_id` when present, or `null` when the prior sibling lacks the field (legacy pre-#346 review). The field is **omitted entirely** on the first iteration (no prior review sibling exists).
     - `prior_rubric_inferred` (`str`, conditional): present when `prior_rubric_id == null` AND a prior review sibling exists (i.e., the prior review is legacy and predates per-review version stamping). Value is `"/40-legacy"` to signal "this thread's prior iteration was scored against the pre-#346 /40 rubric (whatever the skill shipped at the time)". Lets a reader see at a glance that the score-delta `prior_iteration_total -> current_iteration_total` may be comparing /40 against /44 and should be treated with care.
     The block surfaces the rubric version transition when one occurred: the `findings.md` rubric-transition subsection (see step 10) is emitted in parallel for the reviser's actionable view. **Backwards-compat**: a legacy review sibling produced before issue #346 MAY omit this block entirely; downstream consumers MUST tolerate the absence. The block does **NOT** participate in `critical_flag` — it is audit-trail metadata, not a check result.
   - The top-level `rubric_overrides` block (issue #233 / #265) is populated from the cached `RubricOverrides` from step 4h. The block lives at the **top level** of `_summary.md` (sibling to `lint`, `render_gate`, `summary_detail_consistency`, `cross_thread_cite_consistency`, `scope_distribution`, and `strongman_back_check`), NOT nested under `lint` — rationale: the existing `lint` namespace is reserved for deterministic mechanical checks; `rubric_overrides` is **per-thread reviewer configuration**, not a check result. The block exists so the operator and downstream consumers can see at a glance *which* calibrations the reviewer applied to which dimensions, with the verbatim override text recorded for the audit trail (mirroring the suffix text written into `scoring.md`). Shape:
     - `ran` (`bool`): whether any rubric override was loaded. `true` when the loader returned a non-empty `RubricOverrides` (any of `memo_subtype`, `calibrations`, `target_length`, or `unknown_keys` populated); `false` when the loader returned an empty instance (no BRIEF.md, no matching `documents:` entry, no `rubric_overrides:` block on the matching entry, or a malformed BRIEF — see the loader's lenient-form contract on `load_rubric_overrides_for_slug`).
     - `reason` (`str`, only when `ran: false`): short tag — `"no rubric_overrides block on BRIEF.md documents entry"`.
     - `memo_subtype` (`str | null`, only when `ran: true`): the verbatim `memo_subtype` string from the loader, or `null` when not declared. Opaque to the reviewer logic; surfaced for operator-side audit and for future-shipped tooling (e.g., a CI hook that asserts "all synthesis-brief threads carry dim_1_calibration").
     - `calibrations_applied` (`list[dict]`, only when `ran: true`): one entry per dimension with a `dim_N_calibration` declared. Each entry is `{dimension: int (1-9), text: str}`. The `text` field is **verbatim** from the loader — the same string that was appended as a suffix to `scoring.md`. Order is by dimension number ascending (the loader's sort order). When no calibrations are declared, the list is `[]`.
     - `target_length_present` (`bool`, only when `ran: true`): `true` when the loader parsed a `rubric_overrides.target_length` block. The reviewer does NOT consume this field for dim 7 scoring (the resolved range from `_progress.json.metadata.target_length_resolved` is the dim 7 anchor per step 4); this flag is surfaced so the operator can see WHAT the loader saw. Drafter / reviser are the consumers of `rubric_overrides.target_length`; the reviewer's `_summary.md` just records its presence.
     - `unknown_keys` (`list[str]`, only when `ran: true`): forward-compat passthrough — the keys the loader did not recognize (preserved verbatim by the loader under `RubricOverrides.unknown_keys`). Surfaced here so the operator sees WHICH unrecognized keys were present without having to re-read BRIEF.md. When all keys are recognized, the list is `[]`.
   - **The `rubric_overrides` block does NOT participate in `critical_flag`.** This is by design: calibration overrides are reviewer-configuration metadata, not a check result. The block is observational only — the load-bearing surfacing of the calibrations themselves is the `scoring.md` suffix (per step 5's calibration-suffix rules). The `_summary.md` block is the structured shadow / audit trail.
   - **Backwards-compat**: a legacy review sibling produced before this block shipped MAY omit `rubric_overrides` entirely. Downstream consumers (test suites, tooling) MUST tolerate the absence by treating it as `{ran: false, reason: "block predates issue #265"}`. New reviews produced after this contract ships SHOULD emit the block (`ran: false` with reason when no overrides; `ran: true` with the full shape when overrides are present).
   - The top-level `recommendation_target_resolved` block (issue #348) is populated from the cached `recommendation_target_resolved` value from step 4j. The block lives at the **top level** of `_summary.md` (sibling to the existing `rubric_overrides`, `lint`, `render_gate`, `summary_detail_consistency`, `cross_thread_cite_consistency`, `scope_distribution`, and `strongman_back_check` top-level blocks), **NOT nested under `lint`** or `rubric_overrides` — rationale: the existing `lint` namespace is reserved for deterministic mechanical checks, and `recommendation_target_resolved` is **operator-declared posture metadata** that triggers a dim 1 calibration distinct from the per-doc `rubric_overrides` surface (which targets the project-level BRIEF; this surface targets the thread-level BRIEF). The block exists so the operator and downstream consumers can see at a glance WHETHER the calibration fired and WHAT value the thread-level BRIEF carried, with the audit trail recording why dim 1 was (or was not) calibrated on decision-framework clarity. Shape:
     - `value` (`str | null`): the verbatim `recommendation_target` value from `<thread>/BRIEF.md`'s YAML frontmatter when present and in the closed set (one of `"invest"` / `"pass"` / `"conditional"` / `"undecided"`); `null` when the field was absent, malformed, or set to an unrecognized value.
     - `applied` (`bool`): `true` if and only if `value == "undecided"` and the reviewer applied the decision-framework calibration to dim 1 per step 5's `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration sub-step (and `rubric.md` §"Dim 1 — `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration"). `false` for every other path — including `value: "invest"` / `"pass"` / `"conditional"` (decided posture; standard dim 1 calibration applies) and `value: null` (no posture declared; standard dim 1 calibration applies). The `applied` field is the load-bearing signal a downstream consumer (a test, a CI hook, an operator audit) can check to verify the calibration fired without re-deriving the trigger logic.
   - **The `recommendation_target_resolved` block does NOT participate in `critical_flag`**. This is by design: the field is operator-declared posture metadata that triggers a per-dimension calibration, not a check result. The load-bearing surfacing of the calibration itself is the `scoring.md` suffix (per step 5's `recommendation_target: undecided` calibration sub-step). The `_summary.md` block is the structured shadow / audit trail.
   - **Backwards-compat**: a legacy review sibling produced before this block shipped MAY omit `recommendation_target_resolved` entirely. Downstream consumers MUST tolerate the absence by treating it as `{value: null, applied: false}`. New reviews produced after this contract ships SHOULD emit the block on every review run (with `value: null, applied: false` when the field was not declared or the BRIEF was missing).
   - The top-level `scope_distribution` block (issue #242, Phase A) is a count of `comments.md` entries per `scope` value. Shape:
     - `preserve` (`int`): count of `scope: preserve` comments.
     - `expand` (`int`): count of `scope: expand` comments.
     - `reduce` (`int`): count of `scope: reduce` comments.
   - The block lives at the **top level** of `_summary.md` (sibling to `lint` and `render_gate`), NOT nested under `lint` — the scope label is **reviewer-judgment metadata on each comment**, not a mechanical lint result. Same placement rationale as the `summary_detail_consistency` top-level block (issue #245): the existing `lint` namespace is reserved for deterministic mechanical checks.
   - The `scope_distribution` block is the operator-visible signal that the critic is actually surfacing both directions, not just additions. The canary's "7-of-8-additions diagnostic" (the friction case from the issue body: a strategic critic that produced 7 `scope: expand` comments and 1 `scope: reduce` comment) becomes mechanical: a review with `scope_distribution.reduce == 0` AND `dimensions.9 < 4` is **malformed** per AC 2; the reviewer SHOULD re-run.
   - **The `scope_distribution` block does NOT participate in `critical_flag` in v0** (Phase A). The block is observational: it surfaces the comment-stream balance for the operator and the reviser, but `critical_flag` continues to be driven by the existing pathway (lint errors + summary-detail consistency CONTRADICTED) only. Phase B promotion to gating behavior is a separate decision after canary consumption signal.
   - **Backwards-compat**: a legacy review sibling produced before this block shipped MAY omit `scope_distribution` entirely; downstream consumers (the reviser at #241) MUST tolerate the absence and fall back to severity-only ordering (mirrors the perspective-sibling backwards-compat pattern). New reviews produced after this contract ships MUST emit the block.
   - When `lint.memo_image_refs.errors > 0`, set `critical_flag: true` and append a `critical_flag_notes` entry of type `memo_image_refs_lint` naming the affected source lines. This flag lives under the "fourth-category critical flag" bucket per `rubric.md`'s open-ended "any deal-breaker a sophisticated reader would catch" slot — a memo whose PDF renders with broken-image placeholders is not ship-ready regardless of its prose.
   - The `lint.refs_pdf_extraction` block mirrors the `lint.memo_image_refs` shape and records the PDF refs back-check path's per-run outcome (issue #167). Shape:
     - `ran` (`bool`): whether the PDF text extraction path ran. `True` when `refs_pdf.check_pdftotext_available()` returned `True` AND at least one `<thread>/refs/*.pdf` was present; `False` otherwise (binary absent OR no PDF refs).
     - `reason` (`str`, only when `ran: false`): short tag — `"pdftotext not available"` when the binary is absent, or `"no PDF refs"` when the binary IS available but `<thread>/refs/` contains no `.pdf` files.
     - `remediation` (`str`, only when `ran: false` AND `reason == "pdftotext not available"`): the verbatim `refs_pdf.PDFTOTEXT_REMEDIATION` install-story string, so the consumer sees how to enable the back-check on the next run.
     - `per_file` (`list[dict]`, only when `ran: true`): one entry per `.pdf` ref with `path` (relative to `<thread>/refs/`), `extracted_chars` (length of the extracted text, `0` for image-based / scanned PDFs), and an optional `note` (e.g., `"image-based — likely scanned; would need OCR for back-check"`).
   - **The `refs_pdf_extraction` block is info-level only.** It NEVER sets `critical_flag` — a missing optional binary is not a deal-breaker, and an image-only PDF is also not a deal-breaker (the deduction logic, if any, lives in the `comments.md` verdict-tag entries under dim 3, not here).
   - The top-level `render_gate` block (Phase 4 / issue #196) mirrors the deck-side `_summary.md.lint` block shape (`commands/deck-review.md` step 9 — pre-flight `marp_lint` findings surfaced for the reviser). The memo block is the post-render analog: each finding is one entry of the `GateResult.findings` list emitted by `render_gate.gate(kind="memo")` from PR #185, written to `_progress.json.render_gate` by `memo-render` (PR #193) and read here at step 4c. Shape:
     - `ran` (`bool`): whether `_progress.json.render_gate` was present and parseable. `True` when the memo was rendered by `memo-render`; `False` otherwise (legal pre-Phase-3 state, or `memo-render` not on PATH, or `memo-render` skipped via consumer config).
     - `reason` (`str`, only when `ran: false`): short tag — `"no render_gate block in _progress.json"` (the common pre-Phase-3 / unrendered case).
     - `pages` (`int | null`, only when `ran: true`): the rendered PDF page count from `pdfinfo`. `null` when `pdfinfo` was absent on PATH and the gate could not introspect; otherwise the integer page count of `<thread>.pdf`.
     - `page_cap` (`int | null`, only when `ran: true`): the page cap passed to the gate (memo gate uses target_length-derived range, not page_cap — typically `null`).
     - `compile_status` (`str`, only when `ran: true`): one of `"ok"` / `"failed"` / `"unavailable"` / `"skipped"` per `anvil/lib/render_gate.py`'s `COMPILE_*` constants.
     - `pass` (`bool`, only when `ran: true`): the gate's overall pass/fail signal. `False` when any of the five memo dimensions has an error finding.
     - `errors` / `warnings` / `infos` (`int`, only when `ran: true`): counts of findings by severity, aggregated across all five memo gate dimensions.
     - `findings_by_dimension` (`dict[str, list[dict]]`, only when `ran: true`): findings keyed by gate dimension name (`memo_compile_success` / `memo_page_fit` / `memo_overfull_check` / `memo_image_refs_exist` / `memo_placeholder_scan`). Each entry is `{severity, message, location}` per `GateFinding.to_dict()`. The severities are surfaced verbatim from the gate; the reviewer does NOT re-derive them (the gate's classification — `memo_page_fit` error when `target_length.pages` is declared, warning when `target_length.words` is declared — is the contract per step 4c).
     - `reasons` (`list[str]`, only when `ran: true`): the verbatim `reasons` list from `GateResult.to_json()`, one informational reason per gate dimension that ran.
   - **The `render_gate` block is non-blocking and info-level for the verdict.** It NEVER sets `critical_flag` and NEVER forces `advance: false`. Render-gate findings surface for the operator and inform the dim 7 justification per `rubric.md` §"Length targets" §"Word count is primary; rendered page count is second-layer advisory", but the verdict logic at step 7 (`advance = (total >= 35) AND (no critical flags) AND (lint.errors == 0)`) does NOT consume render-gate findings. A memo that scores ≥35 with no critical flags is advance-eligible even when `render_gate.pass == false` — word count remains the primary length signal and the rendered page count is advisory.
   - **The `memo_image_refs_exist` finding in `render_gate.findings_by_dimension`** is the post-render catch (refs that exist on disk but pandoc's resolver flagged, or symlink / case edge cases), distinct from the source-side `lint.memo_image_refs` block at step 4b. Both blocks are emitted (one per-step). When the source-side lint at step 4b already flagged a broken ref (the common case), the post-render gate's finding for the same ref is informational redundancy — the operator already has the actionable signal from `lint.memo_image_refs.errors_by_path`. The post-render block's purpose is the edge-case catch (pandoc resolver disagreed with the heuristic).
   - The `lint.memo_deck_parity` block (issue #215, Phase A) is populated from the cached `LintResult` returned by step 4d. When the lint skipped (no deck sibling discoverable), the block shape is `{ "ran": false, "deck_sibling": null, "reason": "no deck sibling found at portfolio root; parity check inactive", "warnings": 0, "infos": 0, "only_in_memo": [], "only_in_deck": [], "warnings_by_token": [], "infos_by_token": [] }`. The `ran: false` skip path MUST be recorded — the operator should see WHY the parity check did not fire (same skip-reason convention as `refs_pdf_extraction` and the deck-side's `lint.deck_memo_parity`).
   - **The `lint.memo_deck_parity` block does NOT participate in `critical_flag` in v0** (Phase A ships warning-only). The block is observational: it surfaces drift in `findings.md` and the operator's revision priorities, but `critical_flag` continues to be driven by `lint.memo_image_refs.errors > 0` only (per the verdict logic at step 7, which is byte-identical to a thread without the parity lint enabled). Phase B promotion to error severity (and therefore `advance: false`-gating) is a separate decision deferred per the issue body's Phase A / Phase B contract.
   - **Findings subsection (always emitted)**: write a `## Parity-lint findings (memo↔deck, optional)` subsection into `findings.md` (the review sibling's findings document, sibling to `comments.md`). The subsection is **always present** (subsection emitted even when the lint skipped) so the operator sees WHY the check did or did not fire. v0 ships warning-only — entries surface drift but do NOT block advance. Three shapes:

     ## Parity-lint findings (memo↔deck, optional)

     Each entry comes from the memo↔deck parity lint (step 4d). v0 (Phase A) ships at **warning severity** — entries surface drift in shared hard claims (money, percentages, dates / quarters / FY, named months + year, ALL-CAPS acronyms, unit-bearing integers) but do NOT contribute to `lint_critical_flag` and do NOT block advance. Phase B promotion to error severity is a separate decision after 2–4 weeks of canary consumption signal.

     1. **[warning]** only_in_deck (deck line 31): Hard claim `50-60%` appears in deck but not in the sibling memo. Either reconcile on next `memo-revise`, document the deliberate divergence with `<!-- anvil-lint-disable: memo_deck_parity -->`, or accept the divergence (warning only in v0).

   - The top-level `summary_detail_consistency` block (issue #245, Phase A) is populated from the cached `summary_detail_block` returned by step 4e. The block lives at the **top level** of `_summary.md` (sibling to the existing `lint` and `render_gate` top-level blocks), **NOT nested under `lint`** — rationale: the existing `lint` namespace is reserved for **deterministic mechanical checks** (`memo_image_refs`, `refs_pdf_extraction`, `memo_deck_parity`); the summary-detail back-check is **reviewer judgment**, not a mechanical lint, and naming it `lint.summary_detail_consistency` would misrepresent its character. The top-level placement matches the §"Schema notes" framing in the issue #245 curation. Shape:
     - `ran` (`bool`): whether the back-check ran. `True` when the reviewer identified at least one summary block (callout / abstract / TL;DR / thesis block / "what we believe" frontmatter) to scan; `False` when no summary block was present (short memos without callouts/abstracts).
     - `reason` (`str`, only when `ran: false`): short tag — `"no callout / abstract / thesis block identified in <thread>.md"`. The reviewer is required to record `ran: false` explicitly rather than omitting the block (same convention as `lint.refs_pdf_extraction` and `lint.memo_deck_parity`).
     - `summary_blocks_scanned` (`list[str]`, only when `ran: true`): descriptive labels for each scanned block (e.g., `["callout (page 1)", "§1 thesis paragraph 1"]`).
     - `claims_enumerated` (`int`, only when `ran: true`): total count of load-bearing summary claims identified per `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" §"What counts as a load-bearing summary claim".
     - `findings_count` (`int`, only when `ran: true`): total count of non-`MATCH` findings emitted.
     - `findings_by_severity` (`dict[str, int]`, only when `ran: true`): count of findings per severity bucket, keyed by `"critical"` / `"important"` / `"suggestion"`. The vocabulary deliberately diverges from the existing `lint.*` severity vocabulary (`error` / `warning` / `info`) — see `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" §"Severity ladder" — to signal the different character of the check (judgment vs. mechanical). Implementers SHOULD NOT normalize across vocabularies.
     - `findings` (`list[dict]`, only when `ran: true`): one entry per non-`MATCH` finding. Per-finding fields:
       - `claim_id` (`int`): the 1-based index of the load-bearing summary claim.
       - `claim_excerpt` (`str`): a short excerpt of the summary claim text (e.g., `"Gen 2: those workloads migrate."`).
       - `summary_location` (`str`): where the claim was found (e.g., `"callout bullet 1 (page 1)"`, `"§1 thesis paragraph 1"`).
       - `detail_location` (`str`): the section path where the elaboration was found, or `"(absent)"` when no detail section elaborates the claim.
       - `verdict` (`str`): one of `"ABSENT"` / `"CONTRADICTED"` / `"DIVERGENT"`. (`"MATCH"` is never emitted — matches are observed silently.)
       - `severity` (`str`): one of `"critical"` / `"important"` / `"suggestion"` per the rubric severity ladder.
       - `message` (`str`): a human-readable diagnostic describing the mismatch and naming the load-bearing nouns / numbers / actors involved.
       - `suggested_fix` (`str`): a concrete reviser-actionable fix — typically "rewrite the callout to match §N" OR "rewrite §N to match the callout" with a justification for which framing is load-bearing.
       - `load_bearing_justification` (`str`, only when `severity == "critical"`): a one- or two-sentence justification for why the finding rises to critical severity (e.g., "The callout is the page-1 reader-anchor; a reader who stops after the callout has the wrong mental model.").
     - `critical_flag_candidate` (`bool`, only when `ran: true`): convenience flag. MUST equal `any(f.severity == "critical" and f.verdict == "CONTRADICTED" for f in findings)`. Implementer convention; not duplicated state — the verdict aggregator at step 7 cheaply reads this field to test whether any finding requires a critical-flag entry.
   - **The `summary_detail_consistency` block plugs into `critical_flag` via the existing critical-flag-candidate pathway** (issue #245, Phase A). When `summary_detail_consistency.critical_flag_candidate == true`, the top-level `critical_flag` is set to `true` AND a `critical_flag_notes` entry of type `summary_detail_consistency` is appended with the claim excerpt + contradicting detail location as the justification (mirrors the `memo_image_refs_lint` type at step 4b). `ABSENT` and `DIVERGENT` findings at `important` / `suggestion` severity are observational only — they surface in `findings.md` and the verdict's revision priorities but do NOT contribute to `critical_flag`.
   - **Findings subsection (always emitted)**: write a `## Summary-detail consistency findings` subsection into `findings.md` (sibling to the existing `## Parity-lint findings (memo↔deck, optional)` subsection).

     ## Summary-detail consistency findings

     Each entry comes from the summary-detail consistency back-check (step 4e). The check is reviewer-judgment (Phase A: no Python detector); see `rubric.md` §"Summary-detail consistency" for the verdict-tag rubric (`ABSENT` / `CONTRADICTED` / `DIVERGENT`) and severity ladder (`critical` / `important` / `suggestion`). A `CONTRADICTED` finding at `critical` severity contributes to `verdict.md`'s critical-flag list; `ABSENT` and `DIVERGENT` findings at `important` / `suggestion` severity are observational.

     Summary blocks scanned: callout (page 1), §1 thesis paragraph 1
     Claims enumerated: 4

     1. **[critical]** CONTRADICTED — claim 1 (callout bullet 1, page 1) ↔ §2.2 (Pericles.2): "Gen 2: those workloads migrate." Callout assigns Pericles.3's workload-migration behavior to Pericles.2 (Gen 2). §2.2 describes Pericles.2 as the 9HP analog FE respin family with mission-tuned variants — no DSP/workload migration. §2.3 describes the 12LP+ bridge die (Pericles.3) absorbing stable DSP blocks. The migration belongs to Gen 3, not Gen 2.
        Suggested fix: Either rewrite the callout bullet to say 'Gen 3: workloads migrate into 12LP+' (matching §2.3), or rewrite §2.2/§2.3 to put workload migration in Gen 2 (matching the callout). The detail-side framing is the load-bearing one — recommend correcting the callout.

     2. **[important]** ABSENT — claim 3 (callout bullet 1, page 1) ↔ (absent): "the FPGA is the measurement instrument" Callout asserts the FPGA's role as 'measurement instrument that tells us which compute should move into the 12LP+ chiplet ASIC' — no detailed section elaborates on the measurement methodology or what 'tells us' means operationally. Reader has no way to evaluate the claim.
        Suggested fix: Either add a §2.x subsection elaborating the FPGA-as-measurement-instrument methodology, or soften the callout to remove the operational claim (e.g., 'Gen 1 platform' without the instrument framing).

The top-level placement matches the §"Summary-detail consistency" §"Schema notes" framing (issue #245) and the §"Cross-thread citation back-check" §"Related" framing (issue #236). Shape:
     - `ran` (`bool`): whether the back-check ran. `True` when at least one strongman file (for or against) was discovered in the resolved refs-dir list; `False` when no strongman files were found.

9b. **Emit rubric-version-transition subsection in `findings.md` when the prior rubric differs (issue #346)**: when the cached `prior_rubric_id` from step 3 is non-`None` AND differs from the current `"anvil-memo-v2"`, OR when `prior_rubric_id == None` AND a prior review sibling exists (legacy pre-#346 review), write a `## Rubric version transition` subsection into `findings.md` (sibling to the existing `## Parity-lint findings (memo↔deck, optional)`, `## Summary-detail consistency findings`, `## Cross-thread cite consistency findings`, and `## Strongman back-check findings` subsections). The subsection's purpose is **operator visibility** — it surfaces, in plain prose, the fact that this iteration's score is NOT directly comparable to the prior iteration's score (the threshold pool changed, the dimension count changed, weighted contributions shifted) so an operator reading `verdict.md`'s score-delta numbers does not silently mis-judge. Three shapes:

    When the prior rubric is a different stamped id (e.g., post-#346 thread that started with one rubric and the skill ships a new one — rare but possible):
    ```
    ## Rubric version transition

    This iteration was scored against `anvil-memo-v2` (/44, ≥35); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` was scored against `anvil-memo-v1` (/40, ≥32). The score delta `<prior_total>/40 → <current_total>/44` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/44` against the `≥35/44` threshold.
    ```

    When the prior rubric is legacy (no `rubric_id` stamped):
    ```
    ## Rubric version transition

    This iteration was scored against `anvil-memo-v2` (/44, ≥35); the prior iteration at `<thread>.{N-1}.review/` predates per-review rubric version stamping (issue #346) and was scored against `/40-legacy` — the rubric this skill shipped before the `/40 → /44` migration (likely `anvil-memo-v1`, /40, ≥32). The score delta `<prior_total>/40-legacy → <current_total>/44` is NOT directly comparable — the threshold pool, dimension count, and weighted contributions all changed. A downstream consumer reading the delta SHOULD treat the prior score as advisory only and re-anchor on the current iteration's `<current_total>/44` against the `≥35/44` threshold.
    ```

    When the prior rubric matches the current rubric (the steady-state case — no transition surfaced):
    ```
    (subsection omitted entirely)
    ```

    The subsection is **observational** — it does NOT affect the verdict, the critical-flag list, or the `advance` decision. It is purely audit-trail prose so the operator's mental model stays calibrated across a rubric migration. Backwards-compat: a legacy review sibling produced before this contract shipped does NOT need to be re-emitted.

    - Dimension summary table (per-dim scores; full justifications in `scoring.md`)
    - Top 3 revision priorities (if `advance: false`) — when the lint raised errors, the first priority MUST be "Fix the N missing image references (see `_summary.md` lint block)". When the summary-detail consistency back-check raised a `CONTRADICTED` / `critical` finding (issue #245), the top-3 revision priorities MUST include "Reconcile callout/abstract with detailed sections (see `_summary.md.summary_detail_consistency.findings[critical=true]`)" as priority #1 — the contradicting summary is the page-1 reader-anchor and fixing it precedes other prose work. When the cross-thread cite back-check raised an `ANCHOR-CONTRADICTED` / `critical` finding (issue #236), the top-3 revision priorities MUST include "Reconcile cross-thread citation against cited thread's latest version (see `_summary.md.cross_thread_cite_consistency.findings[critical=true]`)" — a cite that materially contradicts the cited thread's content propagates the factual error and must be fixed before the memo advances. When the strongman back-check raised a `NOT_ADDRESSED` / load-bearing / `critical` finding (issue #330), the top-3 revision priorities MUST include "Address or explicitly scope out the load-bearing objection from `strongman-against.md` (see `_summary.md.strongman_back_check.findings[critical=true]`)" — the strongman author named the objection as load-bearing for the cited thesis, and the memo's silence on it is a load-bearing gap a sophisticated reader would catch.
    - **`scope: reduce` first-priority rule (issue #242 AC 4)**: when **dim 9 scored below full weight (< 4/4)**, the top-3 revision priorities MUST include at least one `scope: reduce` priority citing the specific dim 9 anti-pattern instance the reviser should act on first (e.g., "Collapse §4.2's three-paragraph hedge on PAM4/FEC into one sentence — see `comments.md` § scope: reduce"). This mirrors the existing critical-flag-driven "fix the N missing image references" first-priority precedent and the summary-detail-consistency CONTRADICTED first-priority precedent: when a structural countervailing pressure has fired (dim 9 deduction here, lint error in the precedent, CONTRADICTED finding in the #245 precedent), the verdict's revision priorities explicitly surface it so the reviser does not drown the trim directive in `scope: expand` noise. The `scope: reduce` priority is independent of and additive to the lint / summary-detail-consistency priorities: when multiple fire on the same review, all of them appear in the top-3 (the rubric's "Top 3 revision priorities" cap is the budget, not the count). When dim 9 scored 4/4 (full weight) the `scope: reduce` priority is inactive — the rubric judged the rhetorical economy already converged.
11. **Update `_progress.json`** inside the staging dir: `phases.review.state = done`, `phases.review.completed = <ISO>`. This is the LAST file write before the context manager exits — the manifest verification + atomic rename at exit (issue #350) requires `_progress.json` to be present. Then **exit the `staged_sidecar` context block**: the primitive verifies every name in the required-files manifest exists in the staging dir, then atomically renames `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` → `<thread>.{N}.review/`. The final-named dir only ever exists in **complete** form.
12. **Report**: print the path to the (now-renamed) review dir and a one-line status (e.g., `Reviewed acme-seed.1 → acme-seed.1.review/ (30/44, advance: false, 0 critical flags)`).

## Idempotence and resumability

- A completed review (the final-named `<thread>.{N}.review/` dir exists) is never re-run. Re-invoking is a no-op with a notice. Per the staged-sidecar atomic-rename contract (issue #350), the final dir only ever exists in complete form — `verdict.md`, `scoring.md`, `comments.md`, `_summary.md`, `_meta.json`, and `_progress.json` are all present whenever the final dir exists; partial sidecars cannot manifest under this contract.
- A crashed review (mid-write interrupt) manifests as a leading-dot `.<thread>.{N}.review.tmp/` staging dir, NOT as a partial final dir. The next invocation's `cleanup_stale_staging` sweep in step 1 removes it; the command then re-enters the review phase from a clean slate. Resume-from-staging is intentionally NOT supported in v0 — restart-on-detection is the contract (critics are cheap, restart preserves more invariants).
- Backwards-compat: a pre-#350 partial `<thread>.{N}.review/` dir WITHOUT `verdict.md` is the legacy crash shape; step 2's fallback path deletes it and re-reviews. Once the staged-sidecar contract is the steady state, this branch will never fire.

## Notes for the reviewer agent

- **Be honest**, not encouraging. The skill is not "polish the memo." It is "would I stake my professional reputation on this recommendation?" If the answer is no, score accordingly.
- **Distinguish assertion from research.** A claim without a source is a hypothesis. Most early-draft memos contain too many hypotheses dressed as facts; this is the most common reason for low Evidence Quality scores.
- **Critical flags are not bonus points.** They are statements that the memo has a defect serious enough that a sophisticated reader would stop reading. Use sparingly but use them when warranted.
- **Comments should be actionable.** "Tighten this section" is not useful. "Replace the unsourced TAM figure with a citation or remove the claim" is useful.

## `_progress.json` and `_meta.json` snippets (review sibling)

This command writes the critic-sibling shape documented in `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` (with `for_version` naming the version reviewed). Specifically:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "thread": "<slug>",
  "for_version": <N>,
  "phases": {
    "review": { "state": "done", "started": "<ISO>", "completed": "<ISO>" }
  }
}
```

> Note: using `review` as the phase name here is the documented v0 status quo; new critics should use their own tag per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` (phase-name normalization across skills is deferred under #21 item 11).

And the companion `_meta.json` declaring the scorecard kind and the rubric the reviewer scored against (see `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` §"The discriminator"):

```json
{
  "critic": "review",
  "role": "memo-review.md",
  "started":  "<ISO>",
  "finished": "<ISO>",
  "model": "<model-id>",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "scorecard_kind": "human-verdict",
  "rubric_id": "anvil-memo-v2",
  "rubric_total": 44,
  "advance_threshold": 35
}
```

The three `rubric_*` / `advance_threshold` fields are required for new reviews (post-issue #346) and absent-tolerated for legacy reviews. They let downstream consumers compare scores apples-to-apples across rubric migrations without re-reading the skill's current `rubric.md`.

Merge rule (shallow): preserve fields not touched by this command. Use ISO-8601 UTC timestamps per `anvil/lib/snippets/timestamp.md`.
