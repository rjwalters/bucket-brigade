# Bucket Brigade Visualizer

A modern web application for visualizing multi-agent cooperation in firefighting scenarios.

## Features

- 🎮 **Game Replay**: Step-by-step visualization of firefighting games
- 🏆 **Agent Rankings**: Performance tracking and leaderboard
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Overview of experiments and results
- 💾 **Session Storage**: Client-side data management
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Charts**: Recharts (planned)
- **Data**: Session Storage (upgradeable to database)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build
pnpm run preview
```

### Unit Tests

Unit tests use **Vitest** with **React Testing Library** and **jsdom**.
Tests live colocated with their component as `*.test.{ts,tsx}` files under
`src/`.

```bash
# One-off run (what CI runs)
pnpm run test

# Watch mode while iterating
pnpm run test:watch

# Coverage report
pnpm run test:coverage
```

The Playwright end-to-end suite was renamed to `pnpm run test:e2e` when
Vitest took over the default `test` script — see issue #158.

## Usage

### Loading Data

1. **Run Experiments**: Use the Python scripts to generate game data
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_batch.py --num-games 50
   ```

2. **Upload Results**: Use the Settings page to import:
   - Game replays (JSON files from `replays/` directory)
   - Batch results (CSV files from `results/` directory)

3. **Explore**: Navigate between Dashboard, Game Replay, and Rankings

### Features

#### Game Replay
- Interactive ring-based game board
- Step-by-step night progression
- Agent position and action visualization
- Scenario parameter display
- Real-time statistics

#### Rankings
- Agent performance leaderboard
- Statistical analysis of game results
- Uncertainty quantification
- Historical performance tracking

#### Dashboard
- Experiment overview and statistics
- Quick access to recent games
- Getting started guide

## Data Management

The application uses session storage for data persistence:

- **Game Replays**: Stored as `STORAGE_KEYS.GAME_REPLAYS`
- **Batch Results**: Stored as `STORAGE_KEYS.BATCH_RESULTS`
- **Settings**: Stored as `STORAGE_KEYS.UI_SETTINGS`

Data can be exported/imported via the Settings page.

## Future Enhancements

- Database integration for persistent storage
- Real-time experiment monitoring
- Advanced ranking visualizations
- Agent strategy analysis
- Comparative performance charts
- Export capabilities (videos, reports)

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing TypeScript and React patterns
2. Use Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Maintain type safety throughout
4. Test components with realistic data
5. Follow the established file structure
