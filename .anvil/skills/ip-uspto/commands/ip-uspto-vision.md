description: Vision-model critic for the ip-uspto skill. Enumerates the patent DRAWINGS (per-drawing SVG/PNG) and uses a vision-language model to score USPTO-drawing-specific rendered defects (reference-numeral legibility, line weight / contrast, label placement, figure-number visibility, cross-reference accuracy) that the markdown/LaTeX-source critics cannot see. Does NOT render or critique the spec PDF — the spec prose is a text artifact covered by the text critics.

# ip-uspto-vision — Vision-language-model critic (DRAWINGS ONLY)

**Role**: rendered-artifact critic, scoped to the patent **drawings**.
**Reads**: the drawings under the latest `<thread>.{N}/drawings/` (per-drawing SVG/PNG; PNGs enumerated via `anvil.lib.render.render_matplotlib_figures` when the drawings are matplotlib-sourced).
**Writes**: `<thread>.{N}.vision/` with `_review.json` (canonical schema, `kind=vision`), `_meta.json`, `_progress.json`, and the per-drawing PNGs it evaluated in `drawings/`.

This critic exists because the ip-uspto skill's source-side critics (`review`, `s101`, `s112`, `claims`, `priorart`) never *look at* the rendered drawings. Dimension 7 of `rubric.md` — drawing-text correspondence — can be partially read from the spec/LaTeX source (does every `\refnum{N}` in the spec appear in `drawing-descriptions.md`?), but the source-side reviewer cannot see whether a reference numeral is actually **legible at the scale the examiner reads it**, whether the line art meets 37 CFR 1.84's **black-on-white high-contrast** requirement, whether labels **overlap or fall outside the drawing border**, or whether each sheet carries a visible **"FIG. N"** label. Those are render-time visual facts, invisible in the source. This critic answers them from pixels.

## CRITICAL scope boundary — drawings only

**This critic critiques the patent DRAWINGS, not the specification.** The spec prose (`spec.tex`, `claims.tex`, `abstract.txt`) is a **text artifact**; its content is evaluated by the text critics (`ip-uspto-review`, `ip-uspto-101`, `ip-uspto-112`, `ip-uspto-claims`, `ip-uspto-prior-art`). This critic:

- **Does** walk `<thread>.{N}/drawings/` and enumerate the per-drawing images (SVG / PNG).
- **Does NOT** render the spec to PDF and feed spec pages to the VLM. Rendering `spec.pdf` for vision is explicitly **out of scope** (the spec is prose; a VLM page-image critique of prose adds nothing the text critics do not already cover).

If `<thread>.{N}/drawings/` contains only stubs (`drawing-descriptions.md` with no rendered `fig-*.svg` / `fig-*.png`), this critic has nothing to look at — it records a `no_drawings` notice and exits without a `_review.json` (see "When there are no rendered drawings").

## Owned vision dimensions (five, scored /5 each, /25 total)

This critic owns a separate **ip-uspto drawing vision rubric subset** alongside the patent's main 8-dimension /40 rubric (`rubric.md`). The vision dims appear in the aggregated scorecard via the existing mean-of-non-null aggregator (`anvil/lib/critics.py::aggregate`); no schema or aggregation changes are required.

The rubric is composed from the framework `VisionDimension` / `VisionRubric` primitives in `anvil/lib/vision.py` — it does **NOT** use `default_vision_rubric()` (those six dims are deck-shaped: slide overflow, mathtext, slide density). The ip-uspto drawing rubric is built inline:

```python
from anvil.lib.vision import VisionDimension, VisionRubric

IP_USPTO_VISION_DIMENSIONS = (
    VisionDimension(
        name="reference_numeral_legibility",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Every reference numeral (e.g. '10', '12', '14') is readable "
            "at the scale a USPTO examiner views the sheet (drawings are "
            "reduced to fit the sheet). 5 = every numeral is crisp and "
            "unambiguous; 0 = numerals are blurred, too small, or collide "
            "with line art so the examiner cannot read them."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="line_weight_contrast",
        max=5,
        description=(

            "background, durable and dense, with uniformly thick well-"
            "defined lines. 5 = high-contrast black-on-white, consistent "
            "line weights, no gray fills or anti-aliased mush; 0 = faint / "
            "low-contrast lines, gray shading where prohibited, or color "
            "that will not reproduce in black-and-white."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="label_placement",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Reference-numeral labels and lead lines are placed cleanly: no "
            "labels overlapping each other or the line art, no labels "
            "outside the drawing border / sheet margin, lead lines clearly "
            "terminating at the part they identify. 5 = clean, "
            "unambiguous placement throughout; 0 = labels overlap, cross, "
            "or sit outside the drawing area so the examiner cannot tell "
            "which numeral points to which part."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="figure_number_visibility",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "37 CFR 1.84(u): every drawing/view carries a visible 'FIG. N' "
            "(or 'FIG. NA' for related views) label, positioned per "
            "convention and not clipped. 5 = every sheet/view has a clear, "
            "correctly-formatted figure number; 0 = a drawing is missing "
            "its 'FIG. N' label or the label is illegible / clipped."
        ),
    ),
    VisionDimension(
        name="cross_reference_accuracy",
        max=5,
        description=(
            "Reference numerals drawn on the figures correspond to numerals "
            "described in the spec (the visual half of rubric Dim 7, drawing-"
            "text correspondence). 5 = every numeral visible on a drawing is "
            "one the spec describes, and the part it points to matches the "
            "spec's description of that numeral; 0 = a drawing shows a "
            "numeral the spec never mentions, or points a known numeral at "
            "the wrong part. NOTE: the text half of this check (does every "
            "spec \\refnum{N} appear in a drawing?) is owned by the source-"
            "side `review` critic per rubric Dim 7; this dim is the pixels-"
            "side complement, limited to what is visible on the rendered "
            "drawing."
        ),
    ),
)

IP_USPTO_VISION_RUBRIC = VisionRubric(
    dimensions=IP_USPTO_VISION_DIMENSIONS,
    rubric_id="anvil-ip-uspto-vision-v1",
)
```

| Dim | Name | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| dv1 | `reference_numeral_legibility` | Numerals too small / blurred / colliding with line art to read at examiner scale. The single most common ground for a USPTO drawing objection. |
| dv2 | `line_weight_contrast` | Low-contrast or color line art, gray fills where prohibited, inconsistent line weights — 37 CFR 1.84(l) black-on-white requirement. |
| dv3 | `label_placement` | Labels that overlap, cross, or fall **outside the drawing border**; lead lines that do not clearly terminate at the identified part. |
| dv4 | `figure_number_visibility` | A drawing missing its visible **"FIG. N"** label, or a clipped/illegible one — 37 CFR 1.84(u). |
| dv5 | `cross_reference_accuracy` | A numeral drawn on a figure that the spec never describes, or one pointing at the wrong part. The pixels-side complement of rubric Dim 7 (drawing-text correspondence); the text-source half stays with the `review` critic. |

The five drawing vision dims are scored 0–5 each. The vision critic puts `null` on the patent's 8 main-rubric dimensions (it does not own them); the source-side critics (`review`, `s101`, `s112`, `claims`, `priorart`) put `null` on dv1–dv5. The aggregator merges the scorecards cleanly per the existing rules.

## Critical flags (one shipped framework type)

This critic reuses the framework critical-flag taxonomy in `anvil/lib/vision.py` (no new flag types — the framework taxonomy is authoritative):

- **`rendered_overflow_unrecoverable`** (`CRITICAL_FLAG_RENDERED_OVERFLOW_UNRECOVERABLE`) — a drawing-side analogue of information loss: a reference numeral or a label that is **clipped at the drawing border**, or so illegible / overlapping that the examiner cannot determine which part a load-bearing numeral identifies. Raised when a specific named numeral / part is lost or unreadable in the rendered drawing. This is the drawing equivalent of a clipped table column: load-bearing information present in the source disappears at render time.

The companion framework flag `mathtext_artifact_breaks_meaning` is part of the taxonomy but rarely applies here — patent drawings are line art, not mathtext-laden charts. It remains available if a matplotlib-sourced data-plot figure renders a `$`-bearing label as italic math.

Both flag types short-circuit the aggregated verdict to `BLOCK`. Other drawing defects surface as `Finding` items with severity `major` / `minor` / `nit`.

## Inputs

- **Thread slug** (positional argument).
- **Latest version directory**: highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex`.
- **Drawings directory**: `<thread>.{N}/drawings/`.
  - **matplotlib-sourced drawings** (data-plot figures produced by a `figures` step that ran matplotlib): enumerate the already-rendered PNGs via `anvil.lib.render.render_matplotlib_figures(<thread>.{N}/drawings/)`. This is a no-op walker — it does not re-render.
  - **SVG / PNG line-art drawings** (the default illustrator / TikZ output): enumerate per-drawing image files directly (`fig-1.svg` / `fig-1.png`, `fig-2.svg` / `fig-2.png`, ...). SVGs are rasterized to PNG for the VLM (see "Rasterizing SVG drawings").
- **VLM**: Anthropic SDK by default; consumers without an API key inject a callback per `anvil/lib/vision.py`.

This critic does **not** read `spec.tex` for rendering — it reads it only to build the cross-reference context string passed to the VLM (the master numeral → part-name list, so the VLM can score `cross_reference_accuracy`).

## Outputs

```
<thread>.{N}.vision/
  drawings/
    fig-1.png, fig-2.png, ...      Per-drawing PNGs the VLM evaluated (rasterized from SVG when needed)
  _review.json                     Canonical schema, kind=vision, rendered_artifact=drawings/
  _meta.json                       { critic, role, started, finished, model, scorecard_kind }
  _progress.json                   { version, thread, for_version, phases.vision.{state,started,completed} }
```

`rendered_artifact` is set to `drawings/` (the drawing set), NOT a spec PDF — this critic never renders the spec.

## Procedure

1. **Discover state** + **resume check** (per `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md`). Find the highest `N` with `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex`. If `<thread>.{N}.vision/_progress.json.vision.state == done` and `_review.json` exists, exit early (idempotent).
2. **Enumerate drawings** under `<thread>.{N}/drawings/`:
   - If matplotlib-sourced PNGs are present, collect them via `anvil.lib.render.render_matplotlib_figures(<thread>.{N}/drawings/)`.
   - Otherwise enumerate per-drawing image files (`fig-*.svg`, `fig-*.png`) directly and rasterize any SVGs to PNG (see "Rasterizing SVG drawings").
   - **If no rendered drawings are found** (stubs only): record a `no_drawings` notice and exit without writing `_review.json` (see "When there are no rendered drawings").
3. **Initialize `_progress.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 1,
     "thread": "<slug>",
     "for_version": <N>,
     "phases": { "vision": { "state": "in_progress", "started": "<ISO>" } }
   }
   ```
   and **`_meta.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "critic": "vision",
     "role": "ip-uspto-vision.md",
     "started": "<ISO>",
     "finished": null,
     "model": "claude-opus-4-7-20251022",
     "schema_version": 1,
     "scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"
   }
   ```
   See `anvil/lib/snippets/progress.md` and `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` for the canonical shapes.
4. **Copy the per-drawing PNGs** the critic will evaluate into `<thread>.{N}.vision/drawings/` (so the sibling dir is a self-contained record of exactly what the VLM saw).
5. **Build the cross-reference context**: scan `<thread>.{N}/spec.tex` for `\refnum{<N>}` invocations and assemble a master numeral → part-name list. Pass it to the VLM as the `context` string so it can score `cross_reference_accuracy` against what the spec says each numeral is.
6. **Run the vision critic** with the ip-uspto-drawing-specific rubric:
   ```python
   from anvil.lib.vision import VisionCritic, VisionDimension, VisionRubric

   rubric = VisionRubric(
       dimensions=IP_USPTO_VISION_DIMENSIONS,   # the five dims above
       rubric_id="anvil-ip-uspto-vision-v1",
   )
   critic = VisionCritic(critic_id="ip-uspto-vision")
   review = critic.critique(
       images=drawing_pngs,
       rubric=rubric,
       version_dir="<thread>.<N>",
       rendered_artifact="drawings/",
       context=(
           "These are the patent drawings for application '<thread>'. "
           "Reference numerals and their parts per the spec: "
           "10=housing, 12=input port, 14=processor, 16=output port, ... "
           "Evaluate USPTO 37 CFR 1.84 drawing compliance only."
       ),
   )
   ```
   Consumers without an Anthropic API key (CI, offline development) construct the critic with a `callback=` instead.
7. **Write `_review.json`**:
   - The `critique` call already validated the `Review` against the canonical schema.
   - Serialize with `review.model_dump_json(indent=2)` to `<thread>.{N}.vision/_review.json`.
8. **Update `_progress.json`** and `_meta.json` to `state: done` / `finished: <ISO>`.
9. **Report**: one-line status, e.g. `Vision critic on acme-widget.2 → acme-widget.2.vision/ (drawing vision total 18/25; 3 findings; 1 critical flag: rendered_overflow_unrecoverable on fig-2)`.

## When there are no rendered drawings

The default v0 figurer (`ip-uspto-figures`) produces **stubs for a human illustrator**, not rendered figures. A thread whose `drawings/` directory holds only `drawing-descriptions.md` + `illustrator-brief.md` has nothing for a vision critic to look at. In that case this critic:

- Records `phases.vision.state = "skipped"` and a `metadata.reason = "no_rendered_drawings"` in `_progress.json`.
- Does **not** write a `_review.json` (an empty vision scorecard would pollute the aggregate with five `null`-but-present dims).
- Reports: `Vision critic on acme-widget.2 → skipped (no rendered drawings; figurer produced stubs only). Run ip-uspto-figures --mode tikz or supply illustrator output, then re-run.`

A thread can reach `READY`/`AUDITED` without a drawing vision pass when drawings are human-supplied out of band; but a thread with rendered drawings (TikZ mode, or illustrator output dropped into `drawings/`) SHOULD have a vision pass before finalize — the reviser surfaces a missing vision pass as a gap.

## Rasterizing SVG drawings

The VLM consumes raster images (PNG / JPEG). When a drawing is an SVG (the default illustrator / TikZ vector output), rasterize it to PNG before passing it to the critic:

- Preferred: `rsvg-convert -d 300 -p 300 fig-1.svg -o fig-1.png` (librsvg; `brew install librsvg` / `apt-get install librsvg2-bin`).
- Alternatives: `inkscape --export-type=png --export-dpi=300 fig-1.svg` or `cairosvg fig-1.svg -o fig-1.png` (`pip install cairosvg`).
- Use a high DPI (≥300) — reference-numeral legibility is the headline dimension, and under-rasterized line art will read as "illegible" when the cause is the rasterizer, not the drawing.

Rasterization is a per-drawing shell-out at the command layer; it is intentionally **not** added to `anvil/lib/render.py` (no lib changes for this issue — `render.py`'s `render_matplotlib_figures` already covers the matplotlib-PNG path, and SVG rasterization is a thin, tool-specific step the command performs inline).

## Idempotence and resumability

- Standard: completed = no-op; crashed = re-runnable after deleting partial output.
- **Stale drawings**: if a drawing PNG in `<thread>.{N}.vision/drawings/` is older than its source under `<thread>.{N}/drawings/` (the drawing was updated since the vision pass), re-rasterize and re-evaluate. The rendered drawing is the source of truth for this critic.

## Renderer dependencies

- **For matplotlib-sourced data plots**: no renderer dependency — `anvil.lib.render.render_matplotlib_figures` enumerates already-produced PNGs (it does not re-execute the figure scripts).
- **For SVG line art**: an SVG rasterizer — `rsvg-convert` (librsvg), `inkscape`, or `cairosvg`. See "Rasterizing SVG drawings".
- **No spec PDF render**: this critic never invokes Marp or pandoc; it does not render the spec.

## VLM dependencies

- **Anthropic SDK** (default path): `pip install anthropic`. The default model is `claude-opus-4-7-20251022`; pass a different `model=` to override.
- **No SDK required** (callback path): consumers without an API key inject a `callback=` per `anvil/lib/vision.py`. This is the path the ip-uspto-vision unit tests use.

## Aggregation behavior

This critic's `_review.json` is discovered by `anvil.lib.critics.discover_critics` exactly like the `review`, `s101`, `s112`, `claims`, and `priorart` siblings. The aggregator merges its scorecard into the composite verdict per the existing rules:

- The drawing vision dims (dv1–dv5) appear in the aggregated scorecard alongside the patent's 8 main-rubric dims.
- Per-dim `critical=True` ORs across critics; non-empty `critical_flags` forces `Verdict.BLOCK`.
- The `ip-uspto-revise` command (with no code changes) consumes the vision findings via the same discover-glob → aggregate pattern. See `ip-uspto-revise.md`'s D6 note for the drawing-source-fix guidance (vision findings require edits to the drawing source — SVG / matplotlib — not the spec prose).

See `anvil/lib/README.md` § "Rendered-artifact review (`kind: vision`)" for the worked example.

## Relationship to the source-side critics

The ip-uspto skill runs `review`, `s101`, `s112`, `claims`, and `priorart` as parallel source-side siblings. `.vision/` is an additional optional sibling in the same "N parallel critics, one reviser" sense, scoped to the drawings:

- The text critics own the eight prose/claims/statutory dimensions from `rubric.md`. The `review` critic can read **Dim 7 (drawing-text correspondence)** from the source — does every spec `\refnum{N}` appear in `drawing-descriptions.md`? — but only as a textual cross-check.
- `ip-uspto-vision` owns dv1–dv5 — the rendered-only drawing defects that the source-side critics cannot observe (legibility at examiner scale, line weight/contrast, label placement, figure-number visibility, and the pixels-side half of cross-reference accuracy).

## Notes for the ip-uspto-vision agent

- **Drawings only. Never render or critique the spec.** The whole point of this critic is the *drawings* — line art, numerals, lead lines. The spec prose is a text artifact covered by the text critics; do not feed spec pages to the VLM.
- **Reference-numeral legibility is the signature USPTO drawing defect.** Examiners reduce drawings to fit the sheet; a numeral that is crisp at 100% can be unreadable at the examiner's scale. Treat a load-bearing numeral that is clipped at the border or genuinely unreadable as a `rendered_overflow_unrecoverable` critical flag, not a minor finding.
- **Vision findings require fixing the DRAWING SOURCE, not the spec.** A finding flagging a faint line is a line-weight fix in the SVG / matplotlib source; a finding flagging an overlapping label is a label-placement fix in the drawing; a finding flagging a missing 'FIG. N' is a figure-label fix in the drawing. None of these are spec-prose edits. The `ip-uspto-revise` command surfaces this guidance to the reviser explicitly (see its D6 note).
- **Cross-reference accuracy is split.** The text-source half (does every spec `\refnum{N}` appear in a drawing?) is owned by the `review` critic per rubric Dim 7. This critic owns only the pixels-side half: a numeral *visible on the drawing* that the spec never describes, or that points at the wrong part. Do not double-flag the text half here.
- **Critical flags are sparingly used.** The shipped framework type catches information loss (a clipped or unreadable load-bearing numeral). Other defects surface as findings, not flags.
- **Be specific.** A finding that says "the reference numeral '14' on FIG. 2 overlaps the lead line for '16' and is unreadable" is actionable; "the drawings have label issues" is not. Cite the figure in the `evidence_span` as `drawings/fig-2.png` (or `drawings/fig-2.svg:source`).

**Scorecard kind declaration**: This critic's `_meta.json` SHOULD include `"scorecard_kind": "machine-summary"` per `anvil/lib/snippets/scorecard_kind.md` (matching the rest of the ip-uspto critics). The canonical payload is `_review.json` per #26 (the prose siblings `_summary.md` / `findings.md` are not produced — the vision critic ships `_review.json` directly).
